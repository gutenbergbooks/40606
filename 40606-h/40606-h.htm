<a name="PNanchor_v" id="PNanchor_v"><span class = "pagenum">v</span></a><h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the following pages an endeavour has been
made to give a succinct sketch of the legal
position of the parish clergy of the Church of
England in respect both of spiritualities and
of temporalities. The book, being intended
for their use, does not touch upon the subject
of ordination by which they acquired the status
of deacons or priests. Nor does it deal with the
episcopate or the non-parochial clergy, except so
far as these subjects are connected with the
parochial system.</p>

<p>Like all other human arrangements, our English
Church law is, of course, far from being ideally
perfect. It may be safely affirmed that there has
never been either a Church or a State in which the
law has actually been what it ideally ought to have
been. It is important to recognise the difference
between the two positions; for there has sometimes
been a disposition on the part of individuals
to confuse them, and to treat what they consider
to be the ideal law, as if it were the actual law,
and as if, as such, it demanded their loyal obedience.
Such an attitude, whether in ecclesiastical
<a name="PNanchor_vi" id="PNanchor_vi"><span class = "pagenum">vi</span></a>or civil matters, is anarchical in its tendency; for
it sets up private judgment instead of the constituted
authority as the criterion of what ought
or ought not to be done. It can only be justified
where the actual law is absolutely inconsistent
with the fundamental principles of morality or
of Christian truth. The object of the present
treatise is to state succinctly what the law is,&mdash;not
what it ought to be; and no opinion is expressed
or suggestion offered as to points in which amendment
would be proper or expedient.</p>

<p>Within the limited compass of the book it is
obviously impossible to enter into details; and
the reader who desires information as to these
will find them in the authorities to which reference
is made. It must also be borne in mind
that the general law on the subject of buildings,
property, and pecuniary rights is, in various
places, modified by special local enactments or
customs. These can only be ascertained on the
spot, or by consulting the Acts of Parliament
in which they are embodied or recorded.</p>

<p>One other word of caution is desirable. In
explaining the legal position of the parochial
clergy, it is, of course, necessary to indicate the
exact limits of their rights. If they venture
beyond these limits, they are manifestly in the
wrong. But no community, either ecclesiastical
or civil, could maintain its well-being, or even
its coherence, if every individual were on all
<a name="PNanchor_vii" id="PNanchor_vii"><span class = "pagenum">vii</span></a>occasions to take advantage of the full tether
of his legal rights. It will frequently be wise
and proper for the clergy, in their relations
with their ecclesiastical superiors or with the
lay officials and other laity of the parish, not
to adopt the most uncompromising attitude
which the letter of the law permits to them.
The dictates of love and of Christian forbearance,
and of consideration for the claims of others,
as well as of expediency, will not warrant the
infringement by an individual of the ordinances
of either the Church or the State. But they
will more than justify him in refraining from
taking up a position of defiance which these
ordinances may strictly entitle him to assume.</p>

<h3>GENERAL LEGAL POSITION</h3>


<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_1" id="SN_1_1"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">1</span></a>.  In every country where a Christian Church
is permitted to exist, the power and authority
of her clergy to exercise their functions will rest
upon a triple basis and be subject to twofold restrictions
and limitations. In the first place, (i.)
they derive their spiritual authority from their
ordination, and this authority is independent
of the particular Church to which they belong.
But, in the next place, they are bound on the
one hand (ii.) to obey the regulations of the
Church of which they are the ministers, and
must also, on the other hand, (iii.) conform to
the laws of the country in which they labour.
For they can only actively exercise their functions
by the licence or permission of the ruling power
of that country, and subject to any conditions
which it may choose to impose. These principles
apply equally whether the Church is what we
call established or not. The only difference is
that if the Church is established, her own regulations
are part of the law of the land; whereas,
if she is not established, the law of the land
<a name="PNanchor_2" id="PNanchor_2"><span class = "pagenum">2</span></a>sanctions or suffers the existence of these regulations
as a private contract or arrangement
between the ministers and other members of the
Church. But even in the case of an established
Church, her ministers will obviously be restricted
in the exercise of their functions by civil
regulations which do not form part of the
ecclesiastical law. Thus there may be nothing
in the law of his Church to prevent a clergyman
from holding a religious service or
preaching in a crowded thoroughfare. But in
England and other civilised countries any
attempt to do so would be checked by the
existing laws against the obstruction of highways.
In the following pages no attempt will be
made to point out the non-ecclesiastical laws and
limitations to which a parish priest is subject.
For though they necessarily affect himself and
his spiritual work, they do so only indirectly.
They touch him not as a minister or even as a
Christian, but as a citizen; and they touch his
spiritual work only in so far as that work has
a material and civil element.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_2" id="SN_1_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. Confining then our attention to the ecclesiastical
law under which the parish priest holds
his position and acts in this country, we note
in the first place, that the Church being here
established, this ecclesiastical law is equally the
law of the Church and the law of the State.
This is true whatever be its origin, and however
<a name="PNanchor_3" id="PNanchor_3"><span class = "pagenum">3</span></a>it came into force; and it has always had this
double aspect, since (with the exception of the brief
interval of the Commonwealth&mdash;a period which
is not recognised in our jurisprudence as having
had any legal existence) there never has been a
time in our history when the Church of England
has not been the Established Church of the
nation. Portions of our Church system and
Church law have had an exclusively ecclesiastical
origin, by canon or otherwise, and have been
adopted or acquiesced in by the State. Further
portions have been created by the joint or concurrent
action of the Church and the State.
Other portions again have been due to the sole
action of the civil legislature, which has received
the tacit assent of the Church but has never been
confirmed by any formal ecclesiastical ratification.
From whichever of these three sources any particular
point of our Church law may have been
derived, its validity and obligation is the same.
It binds the Church and her ministers and
members irrespectively of its origin, and is at
present in force unless it has either been formally
repealed or become obsolete and fallen into
desuetude.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_3" id="SN_1_3"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_3"><span class="label">3</span></a>. Again, like our civil law, our ecclesiastical
law is in part written and in part unwritten or
customary. Foreign canon or conciliar law or
papal law is only binding in England so far as
it has been received by immemorial custom, and
<a name="PNanchor_4" id="PNanchor_4"><span class = "pagenum">4</span></a>has thus become part of our unwritten law, or
has been incorporated into our written law by the
ratification of an Act of Parliament, or a canon or
constitution of our own Church; and the binding
force of the English Pre-Reformation canons, ordinances,
and provincial constitutions stands on
the same footing. For the Commission authorised
by the Act for the Submission of the Clergy
of 1533 to examine the English canons and constitutions,
and, with the king's assent, declare
which of them should be in force and which
should be abrogated, was never appointed, although
the time for its appointment was extended
by Acts of 1535 and 1543, and the scope
of its inquiry was extended by the latter Act so
as to include foreign canons and ordinances.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Consequently the only written Church law is to
be found in Acts of Parliament and the Prayer-Book,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and in Post-Reformation canons, which,
<a name="PNanchor_5" id="PNanchor_5"><span class = "pagenum">5</span></a>however, except so far as they are confirmed by
Act of Parliament, or declare the unwritten law
of the Church, are only binding on the clergy.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Of these the chief are those known as the Canons
of 1603, which were agreed upon at the sitting of
the Canterbury Convocation begun in that year,
and were separately passed two years afterwards
by the York Convocation. Many portions of
them are, however, now obsolete; and Canon 36
and the last words of Canon 102 have been superseded
by new canons made in 1865-66 and 1888.
The Canons of 1640 were passed after the dissolution
of Parliament, which, according to the
custom of the realm, put an end also to the
existence of Convocation, and they have no
legal force.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_4" id="SN_1_4"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">4</span></a>. Much discussion has arisen upon a fourth
source of Church law, namely, the decisions of
our ecclesiastical courts. It is important to
draw a clear distinction between legislative and
judicial functions. A court, whether ecclesiastical
or civil, has nothing to do with enacting laws.
Its province is confined to interpreting them,
<a name="PNanchor_6" id="PNanchor_6"><span class = "pagenum">6</span></a>when their meaning is obscure or disputed. No
doubt, in the course of this interpretation, it will
sometimes make law by deciding in a particular
way a point on which the legislature has left the
matter in doubt, and has not itself clearly laid
down the law. Many questions affecting the
clergy and the Church have, in fact, been thus
determined by our civil as well as by our ecclesiastical
tribunals. But if one of our civil courts,
in interpreting the civil law, delivers a decision
which does not commend itself to the common
sense of the nation, it is recognised that the
remedy lies not in altering the constitution of
the court and endeavouring to obtain a fresh
legal decision which shall upset the other, but in
obtaining an Act of Parliament expressly over-ruling
the unsatisfactory decision. If this is not
done, the law may have been technically judge-made,
but it is acquiesced in and assented to by
Parliament and the nation. The same principle
applies to the decisions of ecclesiastical courts.
The natural way of getting rid of an obnoxious
decision is not by fresh adjudication, but by legislation.
Until it has been reversed by one or other
of these means, the decision of a court, which <i>de
facto</i> possesses ecclesiastical jurisdiction, is binding
upon the Church as part of her law for the
time being. We have somewhat lost sight of
this principle, owing to the extreme difficulty of
obtaining any definition or alteration of Church
<a name="PNanchor_7" id="PNanchor_7"><span class = "pagenum">7</span></a>law by a legislative process. But the true remedy
lies in a healthy revival of the exercise of ecclesiastical
legislation, and not in an endeavour to
make the ecclesiastical judicature, whether as now
existing or after a reform of the courts, discharge
legislative functions which are wholly outside its
proper province.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_5" id="SN_1_5"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">5</span></a>. The legal position of the parochial clergy
depends for its ultimate origin upon the legal
status of the ancient <i>Parish</i>. The word is the
English form of the Greek &#960;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#8055;&#945; (habitation),
and the Latin <i>parochia</i>, an expression originally
synonymous with diocese (Gr. &#948;&#953;&#959;&#8055;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;, <i>i.e.</i> administration;
Lat. <i>di&oelig;cesis</i>, used of a district or
part of a province in the Roman Empire), and
applied to the territory assigned to the jurisdiction
of a bishop, which was served by him and
a college of clergy under him. But under Archbishop
Theodore (668-690) or shortly after his
time the process was begun of encouraging the
lords of manors and great landowners to build
churches for themselves and their dependants,
and devote the tithes of their manors or estates
to the maintenance of divine worship in these
churches, and the performance of religious duties
among the residents on the estates. This process
was gradually extended throughout the country,
and, wherever it was adopted, the tithes were
assigned either to the priest for the time being
in charge of the church, who was in that case
<a name="PNanchor_8" id="PNanchor_8"><span class = "pagenum">8</span></a>called the <i>rector</i> (governor of the church) or
<i>parson</i> (Lat. <i>persona</i>)<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or to a monastery, the
members of which were then expected to serve
the church. The manor or estate, including any
detached and outlying portions, became the parish
of the church, and developed into a territorial
unit not only for ecclesiastical but also for many
civil purposes. Where the church was served
by a single rector, the landowner who had
endowed it and his successors after him were
given in return the right of nominating to the
bishop a clerk in Holy Orders to become rector
of the church, or, in other words, they acquired
the <i>patronage</i> or <i>advowson</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the benefice. The
frequent cases of neglect in the service of the
parish, where a monastery was rector, led, in the
thirteenth century, to the requirement that in such
cases a succession of individual priests should be
appointed to discharge the duty, with a definite
portion of the endowments of the benefice as
their stipend for so doing. As a rule the great
tithes, being those of corn, grain, hay, and wood,
<a name="PNanchor_9" id="PNanchor_9"><span class = "pagenum">9</span></a>were reserved to the monastery, and were in
consequence styled rectorial tithes, while the
officiating priest, who was styled a <i>vicar</i>, was
endowed with the remaining or small tithes,
which consequently were called vicarial. But
in a few instances the officiating priest, instead
of becoming entitled to the small tithes, only
received a fixed monetary stipend. Where this
occurred, he was called a <i>perpetual curate</i>. It
was the rule that rectories, whether in the hands
of a monastery or a succession of individual
priests, should be endowed not only with the
tithes of the parish, but also with a house and
lands, which are called glebe; and sometimes
these houses and lands, or a part of the lands,
were assigned towards the stipend of the
vicar.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_6" id="SN_1_6"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_6"><span class="label">6</span></a>. Towards the close of Henry VIII.'s reign the
monasteries were dissolved, and their rectories and
the rectorial tithes of the parishes and other endowments
attached thereto, and the right of nominating
vicars or perpetual curates to the parishes
passed, with the rest of the monastic property, in
some cases into the hands of the Crown or of
private individuals who received grants of them
from the Crown, while in other cases they went
to the endowment of episcopal sees or of colleges,
hospitals, or other public institutions. Whichever
happened, the rectory and rectorial tithes
became thenceforth <i>impropriate</i>, and the vicar or
<a name="PNanchor_10" id="PNanchor_10"><span class = "pagenum">10</span></a>perpetual curate was left with the vicarial tithes
and other endowments, or a stipend, as the case
might be, to serve the parish as the beneficed parish
priest.  Later on, and particularly during the
nineteenth century, the growth of the population
and the rapid increase of our urban centres, owing
to the steady migration from the villages to the
towns, has rendered the building of new churches
and the creation of new ecclesiastical areas a
matter of pressing importance; and the same
causes have necessitated the employment in the
larger parishes of additional clergy, whether
stipendiary or voluntary. In some cases an old
parish has been divided into distinct and separate
parishes, each of which has received a portion of
the old church endowments, and has become a
rectory, vicarage, or perpetual curacy, according
to the <i>status</i> of the old parish;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or a vicarage
has been converted into a rectory upon a surrender
of the rectorial tithes by the impropriator.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But,
as a rule, new ecclesiastical districts or parishes
have been formed and churches built without
resorting to the old endowments; and the Church
Building and New Parishes Acts provided that
the ministers put in charge of these new districts
or parishes and churches should be perpetual
curates, and should, like the old rectors, vicars,
and perpetual curates, be corporations, with
<a name="PNanchor_11" id="PNanchor_11"><span class = "pagenum">11</span></a>perpetual succession.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>  But in 1868 it was enacted
that the incumbent of every parish and new
ecclesiastical parish, who was authorised to publish
banns, and solemnise marriages, churchings,
and baptisms in his church, and was not a rector,
should, for the purpose of designation only, be
styled a vicar, and his benefice should for the
same purpose be styled a vicarage.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The modern
<a name="PNanchor_12" id="PNanchor_12"><span class = "pagenum">12</span></a>generic title, which includes every beneficed parish
priest, is <i>incumbent</i>. The proper and ancient
term for rectors, vicars, and all other parochial
clergy, whether beneficed or unbeneficed, is <i>curate</i>,
as having the cure of souls within the parish.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
But in modern practice this term, when used by
itself, is generally applied to the unbeneficed or
assistant curates in a parish.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_7" id="SN_1_7"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_7"><span class="label">7</span></a>. Two other classes of parochial clergy remain
to be mentioned. Where, for any reason,
the incumbent is for a prolonged period disabled
from performing the duties of his office, a
substitute will be appointed under the designation
of Minister in Charge. Again, in some parishes,
lectureships have been endowed, and are held by
a lecturer, who, in respect of his duties as such,
is independent of the incumbent.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_8" id="SN_1_8"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_8"><span class="label">8</span></a>. Under the Colonial Clergy Act, 1874, a

to be admitted to any preferment or to act as
curate in England without the previous consent
in writing of the bishop of the diocese. But a
person who holds preferment or a curacy in an
English diocese under the Act of 1874, and who
has held preferment or acted as curate for a
period or periods exceeding in the aggregate two
years, may, with the written consent of the bishop,
request from the archbishop of the province a
licence to exercise his clerical office according to
the provisions of the Act; and this licence, if
issued by the archbishop and registered in the
provincial registry, will place him in the same
position as if he had been ordained for service in
England by an English bishop.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Moreover, a
clergyman ordained by a bishop of the Scottish
Episcopal Church, unless he holds or has previously
held preferment in England or Ireland,
(<i>a</i>) is liable to a penalty if he officiates in England
more than once within three months without
notification to the bishop of the diocese, or if
he officiates contrary to an injunction of the
bishop; and (<i>b</i>) is not entitled to be admitted to
<a name="PNanchor_14" id="PNanchor_14"><span class = "pagenum">14</span></a>any preferment in England without the bishop's
consent, which he may withhold without assigning
any reason; and (<i>c</i>) before being admitted or
licensed to any preferment or curacy in England,
must make and subscribe before the bishop of the
diocese, the Declaration of Assent prescribed by
the Clerical Subscription Act, 1865.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_9" id="SN_1_9"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_9"><span class="label">9</span></a>. All rectories, vicarages, and perpetual curacies,
whether ancient or established under the Church
Building and New Parishes Acts, or under any
special Act of Parliament, fall within the term
<i>benefice</i>, and are of freehold tenure. The term is
also applied to non-parochial ecclesiastical offices
of a like tenure, such as a deanery, canonry, and
archdeaconry. But in the present treatise, which
deals only with the parochial clergy, it will be
used exclusively of the above-named parochial
benefices (which are in popular language called
<i>livings</i>); and the clergy who hold these benefices
will be called beneficed clergy or incumbents.
The other parochial clergy will be referred to as
unbeneficed clergy or curates. The legal position
of the unbeneficed clergy as regards status and
property is so different from that of incumbents
that it will be convenient to treat of them
separately. But the spiritual duties of the two
classes, and the discipline to which they are
amenable, are similar and can be discussed
<a name="PNanchor_15" id="PNanchor_15"><span class = "pagenum">15</span></a>together. They are alike subject to the same
superior ecclesiastical officials and to the same
judicial proceedings; and their civil privileges
and disabilities in respect of their clerical office
are identical. By virtue of their position as
parochial clergy they are brought into certain
relations with the bishop of the diocese, the archdeacon
of the archdeaconry, and the rural dean of
the deanery in which their parish is situate.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_10" id="SN_1_10"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_10"><span class="label">10</span></a>. The bishop is not only the ruler and administrator,
but also the chief pastor of the whole of
his diocese. As such, he, assisted by his chaplain,
has the right whenever he pleases, without the
consent of the incumbent, to conduct service or
preach in the church of any parish in such lawful
manner as he thinks proper. This right extends
to consecrating a church within the parish<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and,
of course, to holding ordinations and confirmations.
Moreover, he can require from the
clergy all reasonable information respecting their
parish and parishioners. They owe to him
canonical obedience,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and deference in matters
which do not fall within the limits of obedience.
With the exception that his withdrawal of a licence
from a curate is subject to an appeal to the
archbishop, he possesses absolute control over the
unbeneficed clergy in his diocese, having the right
to inhibit them from officiating within it. But
<a name="PNanchor_16" id="PNanchor_16"><span class = "pagenum">16</span></a>he has no such power over the beneficed clergy in
respect of their services in their own church and
other matters involved in the cure of souls attaching
to their benefice. In respect of these
matters, their office being a freehold for life,
they are independent of him except in such
particulars and to such extent as the law has
expressly prescribed, and they can only be
constrained by him against their will through
the instrumentality of legal proceedings. But,
equally with the unbeneficed clergy of the diocese,
it is their duty to attend the bishop's triennial
visitations; and their absence without sufficient
cause renders them liable to ecclesiastical censure
and punishment. Moreover, as will be noticed in
the course of this treatise, the bishop has been
given, by express enactments, divers powers in
relation to both beneficed and unbeneficed clergy
on matters of detail, subject in many cases to
an appeal to the archbishop of the province.
By law and custom part of the administrative
functions of the bishop and almost the whole
of his judicial functions are discharged by his
chancellor, who is at once his vicar-general and
the official principal of his consistory court.
Suffragan bishops, where they are appointed,
have no independent authority or jurisdiction,
but simply so much as the diocesan bishop, in
his discretion, from time to time delegates to
them.</p></div>

next in point of dignity after the bishop and
the suffragans (if any) and the chancellor of the
diocese.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He is sometimes called <i>oculus episcopi</i>,
being the bishop's vicar, charged with the duty
of inspecting that portion of the diocese which
is under his charge and of reporting to the bishop
anything which is amiss. Besides this general
supervision, he holds an annual visitation of his
archdeaconry, and admits the churchwardens and
sidesmen, except in years of episcopal visitation,
when he is inhibited from performing his functions,
and these are exercised instead by the bishop in
person, or, as regards the admission of churchwardens
and sidesmen, by the chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> At his
annual visitation, and at other times, as occasion
arises, it is the business of the archdeacon to
satisfy himself that churches, and especially chancels,
are in a proper condition, and to require that
any necessary repairs be executed; to take note
of the ornaments and utensils of churches, and
to ascertain that the services and offices of the
Church are everywhere duly performed and administered.
The clergy are bound to assist the
archdeacon in his inspection and inquiries and to
<a name="PNanchor_18" id="PNanchor_18"><span class = "pagenum">18</span></a>attend his visitations.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Various duties assigned

the same functions and powers of inspection and
report as an archdeacon in his archdeaconry. It
is their duty to hold from time to time chapters
consisting of the beneficed clergy of the deanery

present day these chapters are usually attended
not only by the incumbents but also by all the
licensed unbeneficed clergy of the deanery.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_13" id="SN_1_13"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_13"><span class="label">13</span></a>. Judicial procedure in the case of clerical
offences is regulated by three statutes of the last
century: (i.) The Church Discipline Act, 1840,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
provides that on a complaint or the existence of
evil report against a clergyman the bishop may,
with the consent of the parties, at once pronounce
sentence, and, in the absence of such consent, may,
if he thinks fit, issue a commission of inquiry. If
the commission reports that there is <i>primâ facie</i>
ground for proceedings, the bishop may either
<a name="PNanchor_19" id="PNanchor_19"><span class = "pagenum">19</span></a>try the case in person with assessors, or else send
it by letters of request direct to the provincial
court. The latter course has in practice been
generally adopted, and an appeal may be carried
to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
(ii.) The Public Worship Regulation Act, 1874,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
introduced an alternative procedure in matters of
ornament and ritual. On the representation of
the archdeacon or a churchwarden or any three
parishioners, the bishop, unless he is of opinion
that no proceedings should be taken upon it, is
to require the parties to state whether they are
willing to submit to his directions in the matter,
and if they assent he is to hear the case and pronounce
judgment as he thinks proper, and no
appeal is to lie from his judgment. But if they
decline to submit the case to the bishop, it is to
be heard by the judge appointed under the Act,
who is in fact the same person as the judge of the
two provincial courts, and an appeal lies from his
decision to the Judicial Committee. (iii.) The
Clergy Discipline Act, 1892,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> prescribed a new
mode of dealing with offences against morality.
In certain cases where the offence is proved by a
conviction and sentence or an order of a temporal
court, the offending clergyman is to be incapable
of holding preferment, and the bishop is to declare
vacant any preferment which he holds without
any further trial. But in all other cases proceedings
<a name="PNanchor_20" id="PNanchor_20"><span class = "pagenum">20</span></a>are to be taken in the consistory court before
the chancellor of the diocese, with the addition of
four assessors to try any question of fact, if either
party demands them. Either party may appeal
against the judgment of the consistory court on
a question of law, and the accused clergyman may,
with the leave of the appellate court, appeal on a
question of fact. The appeal may at the option
of the appellant be either to the provincial court
or to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
but if it is made to the provincial court the
decision of that court is final. The net result of
the three Acts is that (i.) offences of the clergy in
respect of morality can only be dealt with under
the Act of 1892; (ii.) proceedings for offences in
respect of ritual and the ornaments of the church
or the minister may be taken either under the
Act of 1840 or under that of 1874; and (iii.)
offences in respect of doctrine, as well as all other
offences which do not come under (i.) or (ii.), must
be dealt with under the Act of 1840.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_14" id="SN_1_14"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_14"><span class="label">14</span></a>. Priests, at their ordination, are reminded
of their duty to forsake and set aside, as much as
possible, all worldly cares and studies, and are
exhorted to apply themselves wholly to their
sacred office, and draw all their cares and studies
that way; and they promise, among other things,
to lay aside the study of the world and the flesh.
No similar expressions occur in the form for
the making of deacons; but our law recognises
<a name="PNanchor_21" id="PNanchor_21"><span class = "pagenum">21</span></a>no distinction between the two orders of clergy
in respect of their civil privileges and disabilities.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_1_15" id="SN_1_15"></a><a href="#SNanchor_1_15"><span class="label">15</span></a>. A clergyman, whether priest or deacon,
is not compellable to serve on a jury, though it is
not illegal for him to do so.  He may be appointed
a justice of the peace or guardian
of the poor, may be a member of a parish or
district council, and  may act as chairman,
alderman, or councillor of a county council, and
as mayor, alderman, or councillor of any of the
Metropolitan boroughs.  But he is disqualified
from being mayor, alderman, or councillor of
any other municipal borough;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and he cannot

persons to resort, except for their honest necessities,
to taverns or alehouses, or to board or lodge
therein, or to spend their time in drinking or riot
or playing at dice, cards, or tables, or any other
unlawful games, but also prohibits them from
engaging in any base or servile labour.  And
a clergyman who holds any cathedral preferment,
benefice, curacy, or lectureship, or is licensed
<a name="PNanchor_22" id="PNanchor_22"><span class = "pagenum">22</span></a>or is otherwise allowed to perform the duties
of any ecclesiastical office, is subject to certain
specific legal restrictions as to engaging in business
or trade. (<i>a</i>) He may not acquire for
occupation, use, or cultivation more than eighty
acres of land without the written permission
of the bishop, which must be restricted to a
specified number of years not exceeding seven. (<i>b</i>)
He may not engage in any trade or dealing for
profit except where it is carried on by more than
six partners, or by a company, or where the concern,
or a share in it, has devolved on him under
a will or settlement, or by inheritance or marriage
or bankruptcy; and in none of the excepted
cases may he act as a director or managing
partner, or carry on the concern in person.
These restrictions, however, do not extend to
keeping a school or seminary, or being employed
as a schoolmaster or tutor, or being concerned in
education for profit, or buying or selling or
otherwise acting in relation to such school,
seminary, or employment. Nor of course do they
prevent an incumbent from farming, if he pleases,
his own glebe lands. Nor do they interfere with
the sale, even at an enhanced price, of goods which
a clergyman actually buys for the use of his
household, but afterwards does not want to keep,
nor with the sale of books to or through a bookseller
or publisher. He may also be a manager,
director, partner, or shareholder in any benefit
<a name="PNanchor_23" id="PNanchor_23"><span class = "pagenum">23</span></a>society, or fire or life assurance society, and
may sell minerals from mines on his own lands,
and also (provided he do not do so in person at a
market or other public sale) may buy and resell
for profit cattle, corn, and other things required
for the occupation, cultivation, and improvement
of glebe or other lands lawfully held by him.
The penalties for unlawfully trading are, for the
first offence, suspension for not exceeding one
year, for the second offence suspension for a longer
period, and for the third offence deprivation

by statute, after resigning all preferments held by
him, he can surrender all clerical rights and

if he executes a deed of relinquishment
in the prescribed form, and causes it to be
enrolled in the Central Office of the Supreme
Court of Judicature, and delivers an office copy
of the enrolment to the bishop of the diocese

never held preferment) in which he resides, and
gives notice of having done so to the archbishop

by the bishop, as primarily charged with the
cure of souls throughout his diocese; but, unless
there is good legal reason to the contrary, he is
bound to admit the clerk who is presented by the
patron of the benefice, if the presentation is made
within six calendar months after the benefice became
vacant. If that period passes without a
presentation being made, the right of appointment
lapses to the bishop. If he does not
appoint within a further like period, it goes to the
archbishop of the province, and if he fails to
appoint within another period of six calendar
months, it devolves finally on the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The

begin to run from the time when notice of the
fact is given by the bishop to the patron,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> except
in the case of an ecclesiastical patron who
(unless the case comes under the Benefices Act,
1898, ss. 2, 3) is not entitled to such notice.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Moreover, in reckoning the period for lapse, no
account is to be taken, in the case of the first and
second presentations by a patron in respect of the
same vacancy, of the time between a presentation
and the bishop's refusal to admit the presentee,
or of the period between that refusal and a
decision of a court upon it, nor, in the case of a
collation by the bishop, of the time between the
service of the prescribed notice on the churchwardens
and the expiration of a month from
that service.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_2" id="SN_2_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. The original connection of advowsons or
rights of presentation with manors or estates<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
led to their passing by devolution or devise on
death, or by gift or sale during life, to the heir
of the patron, or to a devisee, donee, or purchaser
of the manor or estate; and it soon became recognised
in law that they could be alienated by themselves
like any other property, apart from the
<a name="PNanchor_27" id="PNanchor_27"><span class = "pagenum">27</span></a>manors to which they were originally appendant.
Moreover, until 1899 the law allowed a patron to
grant or sell the right of next presentation, or
the right of presentation during his lifetime, or
any other limited interest in the patronage, reserving
the fee-simple of the advowson to himself.
By an Act of 1713,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> a clergyman was prohibited
from purchasing a next presentation and then presenting
himself; but this has been held not to prevent
him from presenting himself after purchasing
an estate in fee, or even an estate for life in the
advowson.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And if the benefice is vacant at the

existing vacancy.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This, however, was, until 1899,
frequently got over by an agreement that the transferor
should present such clerk as the transferee
might nominate. But the Benefices Act, 1898,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
introduced several salutary restrictions on the
transfer of advowsons. Under sect. 1 of that
Act:&mdash;</p></div>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A transfer of an advowson (otherwise than
on marriage, death, or bankruptcy, or on the appointment
of a new trustee) is invalid unless it
(i.) transfers the whole interest of the transferor
in the advowson (except that he may reserve to
himself a life interest in making a family settlement,
<a name="PNanchor_28" id="PNanchor_28"><span class = "pagenum">28</span></a>and the equity of redemption in making a
mortgage); (ii.) is made more than twelve months
after the last filling up of the benefice; and (iii.)
is registered in the diocesan registry within one
month after its date, or such extended period as
the bishop may under special circumstances permit.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The advowson must not be put up to
auction unless sold with a manor or not less
than 100 acres of land belonging to the same
owner in the same or an adjoining parish.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Subsection (3) of the same section also makes
invalid any agreement to exercise patronage in
favour of or on the nomination of a particular
person, and also, in connection with the transfer
of an advowson, any agreement (i.) to retransfer
the advowson; (ii.) to postpone payment of any
part of the purchase money, or to pay interest
until a vacancy in the living, or for more than
three months; (iv.) to make any payment in respect
of the date at which the vacancy may
occur; or (v.) that the living shall be resigned
in favour of any person. If the patron of a benefice
is a Roman Catholic, the University of Oxford
or of Cambridge has the right to present.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> A Jew
who owns an advowson may present; but if a Jew
holds an office under the Crown to which a right
of presentation is attached, the right passes to
the Archbishop of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

qualified to be appointed to a benefice. But,
unless he has been so ordained by a bishop of the
Church of England or of the Church of Ireland,
or by a commissary of an English bishop under
15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. 52, he is subject to the provisions
of the Colonial Clergy Act, 1874,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> or, if ordained

Act, 1864,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as to the previous consent or licence of
the archbishop of the province or bishop of the
diocese; and a clerk ordained priest as an alien
or for service in the colonies under the Ordination
of Aliens Act, 1784, or the Ordinations for
Colonies Act, 1819, is subject to the same provisions.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
The bishop may, however, independently
of the Benefices Act, 1898, refuse to admit
him on the ground of insufficient learning,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> or of
<a name="PNanchor_30" id="PNanchor_30"><span class = "pagenum">30</span></a>vicious conduct, heresy, or offences against ecclesiastical
law in matters of ritual&mdash;anything, in short,
which, if it occurred after admission, might
be a ground for depriving him of the benefice.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
And, under sect. 2 of that Act, the bishop may do
so, (<i>a</i>) if at the date of the vacancy not more than
a year has elapsed since a transfer within the purview
of sect. 1[51] of the right of patronage of the
benefice, unless the transfer is proved not to have
been effected in view of the probability of a
vacancy within the year; or (<i>b</i>) if not more than
three years have elapsed since the presentee was
ordained deacon; or (<i>c</i>) if the presentee is unfit
owing to physical or mental infirmity, serious
pecuniary embarrassment, grave misconduct, or
neglect of duty in an ecclesiastical office, evil life,
or scandal caused by his moral conduct since ordination;
or (<i>d</i>) if he has, with reference to the
presentation, been knowingly party or privy to a
transaction or agreement invalid under the Act.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The 39th Canon lays down that a bishop shall
not institute to a benefice a clergyman who has
been ordained by another bishop, without production
of his letters of orders and a sufficient testimony
of his former good life and behaviour if
the bishop requires it,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and his appearing on
<a name="PNanchor_31" id="PNanchor_31"><span class = "pagenum">31</span></a>due examination to be worthy of his ministry.
What this examination covers is not clearly
definable; but it has not such a wide scope
as the examination contemplated in Canon 48,
which does not apply to presentees to livings.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Under the 95th Canon a bishop is allowed
twenty-eight days for inquiry as to the fitness of
a presentee; but this is merely directory, and he
is not precluded from continuing the inquiry
after their expiration.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_4" id="SN_2_4"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_4"><span class="label">4</span></a>. If a bishop refuses to admit a presentee on
a ground specified in sect. 2 of the Act of 1898,
or on account of any other unfitness or disqualification
sufficient in law, not having reference to
doctrine or ritual, he is to signify in writing his
refusal, and the ground for it, to the patron and
the presentee; and either of them may within
one month thereafter require that the matter
be heard by a court consisting of the archbishop
<a name="PNanchor_32" id="PNanchor_32"><span class = "pagenum">32</span></a>of the province (or if it was the archbishop who
refused to admit, the archbishop of the other
province) and a judge of the Supreme Court,
nominated by the Lord Chancellor. The judge
is to decide all questions of law and fact, and if
the judge finds that there is no fact sufficient in
law to constitute unfitness or disqualification, the
archbishop is to direct the admission of the
presentee. But if the judge finds that such fact
does exist, the archbishop is to decide whether
the presentee is actually in consequence unfit to
serve the benefice, and adjudge whether admission
ought under the circumstances to be refused. In
either case his judgment is to be final.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> When
the bishop has refused to admit a presentee, the

right of further presentation as if he were a lay
patron.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> If a bishop refuses to admit a presentee
on the ground of doctrine or ritual, the old
alternative remedies remain, either (<i>a</i>) of a suit

court of the province, or (<i>b</i>) of an action
of <i>quare impedit</i> by the patron in the High Court
of Justice.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_5" id="SN_2_5"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_5"><span class="label">5</span></a>. Before the bishop admits a clerk to a vacant
<a name="PNanchor_33" id="PNanchor_33"><span class = "pagenum">33</span></a>benefice, he must send to the churchwardens in a
registered letter a formal notice of his intention
so to do, with a statement of the ecclesiastical
preferments which the clerk has held, and a
direction that the notice is to be fixed for one
month on the principal door or notice-board of
the church; after which it is to be returned
to the bishop with a certificate, signed by the
churchwardens, that the direction has been complied
with.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The object of this proceeding is to
give to the parishioners the opportunity of communicating
to the bishop the existence of any
fact known to them which would constitute a

the presentee.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_6" id="SN_2_6"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_6"><span class="label">6</span></a>. The bishop admits a presentee by formal
institution in the case of a rectory or vicarage
(the presentee kneeling before him), and by
licence in the case of a perpetual curacy. In the
case of admission to the benefices of new ecclesiastical
parishes, which though by law perpetual
curacies, are titular vicarages,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the practice
varies. Admission by licence is the correct
course; but by the desire of the presentee himself
institution is sometimes granted. Where the
bishop is himself the patron, he cannot present,
and therefore admits by collation, which corresponds
<a name="PNanchor_34" id="PNanchor_34"><span class = "pagenum">34</span></a>to the two processes of presentation and
institution.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Before institution, collation, or admission

<p>(i.) A declaration of assent, namely&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I assent to the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, and to
the Book of Common Prayer, and of the ordering of
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. I believe the Doctrine of
the Church of England as therein set forth, to be agreeable

of the Sacraments I will use the Form in the

be ordered by lawful authority.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p></blockquote>

rectory (or vicarage, &amp;c.) in consideration of any sum
of money, reward, gift, profit, or benefit directly or indirectly
given or promised by me, or by any person to
my knowledge or with my consent, to any person whatsoever;
and I will not at any time hereafter perform or
<a name="PNanchor_35" id="PNanchor_35"><span class = "pagenum">35</span></a>satisfy any payment, contract, or promise made in respect
of that presentation by any person without my knowledge
or consent.</p>

<p>2. I have not entered, nor, to the best of my knowledge
and belief, has any person entered, into any bond, covenant,
or other assurance or engagement, otherwise than
as allowed by sections one and two of the Clergy Resignation
Bonds Act, 1828,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> that I should at any time resign
the said rectory (or vicarage, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>3. I have not by myself, nor, to my knowledge, has any
person on my behalf, for any sum of money, reward, gift,
profit, or advantage, or for or by means of any promise,
agreement, grant, bond, covenant, or other assurance of
or for any sum of money, reward, gift, profit, or benefit
whatsoever, directly or indirectly procured the now
existing avoidance of the said rectory (or vicarage, &amp;c.)</p>

1898.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>(iii.) The oath of allegiance, namely&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I, A. B., do swear that I will be faithful and bear true
allegiance to His Majesty King Edward the Seventh, His
Heirs and Successors according to Law. So help me <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>(iv.) The oath of canonical obedience, namely&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>I, A. B., do swear that I will perform true and canonical
obedience to the Bishop of C. and his successors in all
things lawful and honest. So help me <span class="smcap">God</span>.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p></blockquote>

necessary to invest him with the actual possession
of its temporalities. The bishop issues his mandate
for the purpose to the archdeacon or some
other person, who, in obedience thereto, goes to
the church, and, placing the clerk's hand upon

and imposes the duty of the cure (Lat. <i>cura</i>) or
care of souls within the parish attached to the
benefice. The nature of this duty can be gathered
from the Form of Ordering of Priests, the rubrics
and provisions of the Book of Common Prayer,
and the Canons of 1603. Every clergyman, at
the time of his ordination as priest, solemnly
promises (<i>a</i>) so to minister the doctrine and
sacraments and the discipline of Christ as the
Lord has commanded, and as the Church and
Realm of England have received the same, and
to teach the people committed to his cure and
charge with all diligence to keep and observe the
same; (<i>b</i>) to be ready to banish and drive away
all erroneous and strange doctrines contrary to
God's Word, and to use both public and private
exhortations, as well to the sick as to the whole,
within his cure, as need requires and occasion is
given; (<i>c</i>) to be diligent in prayers and in reading
of the Holy Scriptures, and in such studies as
help to the knowledge of the same, laying aside
the study of the world and the flesh; (<i>d</i>) to frame
and fashion himself and his family according to
the doctrine of Christ, and to make both himself
and them wholesome examples and patterns to
the flock of Christ; (<i>e</i>) to maintain and set forward
quietness, peace, and love among all Christian
people, and especially among those committed to
his charge; and (<i>f</i>) reverently to obey his ordinary
<a name="PNanchor_39" id="PNanchor_39"><span class = "pagenum">39</span></a>and other chief ministers, following with a
glad mind and will their godly admonitions, and
submitting himself to their godly judgments.
While the cure of souls thus embraces the general
care of the spiritual and moral welfare of the
people, it includes the following particulars, which
will be separately considered: (i.) Residence;
(ii.) Performance of Divine Service, including the
Administration of the Sacraments, Preaching and
Catechising; (iii.) Solemnisation of Marriage;
(iv.) Burial of the Dead; and (v.) Private Ministrations,
including the Visitation of the Sick.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_10" id="SN_2_10"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_10"><span class="label">10</span></a>. Speaking generally, and with the exceptions
and under the restrictions to be presently
mentioned, the incumbent and clergymen permitted
by him have the sole right of ministering
within his parish; and a clergyman who intrudes
and performs any clerical function in it without
his permission, commits an ecclesiastical offence.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
But the bishop, as the chief pastor, has the
right to officiate in any church and parish within
his diocese whenever he pleases. And an incumbent
cannot authorise another clergyman to
officiate in his church or parish without the
licence of the bishop; but this rule has been
held not applicable in its absolute strictness to
<a name="PNanchor_40" id="PNanchor_40"><span class = "pagenum">40</span></a>merely occasional and isolated acts of ministration.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
The few cases in which two or more
incumbents have had the cure of souls within
the same parish, have been dealt with by recent
legislation.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The 28th and 57th Canons prohibited
the practice of persons leaving their own
parish church and communicating or causing
their children to be baptized elsewhere. But this
prohibition is not now in force; and by a general
understanding and comity, especially in towns
subdivided into several ecclesiastical parishes, not
only do Church people frequent at will the particular
church which they prefer, but the incumbent
of that church pays spiritual visits in sickness
and at other times to regular members of his congregation
who reside in another parish.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_11" id="SN_2_11"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_11"><span class="label">11</span></a>. The ministrations of the incumbent himself
are restricted by Canon 71, under which, except
where a person is prevented from going to church
by infirmity or sickness, no minister may preach
or administer the Holy Communion in any private
house in which there is not a chapel dedicated
and allowed by the ecclesiastical law of the realm,
nor, where there is such a chapel, in any other
place but the chapel, and even there only seldom
on Sundays and holy-days in order that the lord
or master of the house and his family may at other
<a name="PNanchor_41" id="PNanchor_41"><span class = "pagenum">41</span></a>times resort to their own parish church and there
receive the Holy Communion at least once every
year. An incumbent can perform Divine service
in any consecrated building in his parish without
a licence from the bishop; but, strictly speaking,
he requires the bishop's licence to authorise him
to do so in any unconsecrated building, whether
within or outside his parish, or anywhere in another
diocese; and a bishop can inhibit an incumbent
of his diocese from officiating within the diocese
elsewhere than in the consecrated buildings within
his own parish. If an incumbent transgresses in
any of these respects he is liable to be sued for an
ecclesiastical offence.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Moreover, strangely enough,
the Acts which legalised the worship of Dissenters
not only withdrew them from the care of the
incumbent of the parish but also restricted his
action among Church people. For these Acts
prohibited any meeting for Protestant religious
worship of more than twenty persons, besides the
family and servants of the house where it was
held, except at a place duly certified for the
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But in 1855 it was enacted that these
prohibitions should not apply to any assembly for
religious worship either (<i>a</i>) conducted by the incumbent
or curate in charge of the parish or any
<a name="PNanchor_42" id="PNanchor_42"><span class = "pagenum">42</span></a>person authorised by him, or (<i>b</i>) meeting in private
premises, or (<i>c</i>) meeting occasionally in a building
not usually appropriated to religious worship.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_12" id="SN_2_12"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_12"><span class="label">12</span></a>. There are also special cases in which the
right of an incumbent to officiate and exercise
the cure of souls is actually superseded in favour
of a chaplain appointed without his consent.
Where a nobleman has a chapel within or attached
to his residence he has the right to appoint
a chaplain to serve it.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The chapels of public and
endowed schools under the Acts of 1868 and 1869
are free from the jurisdiction and control of the
incumbent of the parish in which they are situate.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Moreover, a bishop may license a clergyman to
administer the Lord's Supper and perform services
other than the solemnisation of marriage,
and, subject to the direction of the ordinary, to
dispose of the offertory and collections, in the
chapel of any college, school, hospital, asylum,
or public or charitable institution within his diocese;
and where this is done, the institution and
chapel are withdrawn from the cure of souls and
control of the incumbent of the parish.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> During
the eighteenth and first part of the nineteenth
century, before the Church Building and New
Parishes Acts had afforded facilities for creating
new parishes, unconsecrated proprietary chapels
<a name="PNanchor_43" id="PNanchor_43"><span class = "pagenum">43</span></a>were built in various places, with the consent of
the bishop of the diocese and incumbent of the
parish, to meet the wants of overgrown town
populations. These chapels can only be served by
ministers acting under the licence of the bishop,
(which he can at any time revoke),<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and with the
consent of the incumbent, which, though he cannot
himself revoke it, is not binding on his successors.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Unless the incumbent waives the right to the alms
collected in the chapel, they must be accounted for
to him. The chapel is private property, and no
one can claim to attend it as of right.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_13" id="SN_2_13"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_13"><span class="label">13</span></a>. The right to the cure of souls in a parish
naturally carries with it the right of the incumbent
to a voice in the erection of a new church in
the parish and the severance of any portion of the
parish from his benefice and its formation into a
new ecclesiastical district or parish. The various
modes in which these objects may be effected are
mentioned in the note to Ch. I. § 6 above. The
enactments on the subject provide opportunities
for the incumbents of the existing parishes, which
would be affected by any contemplated action in
the matter, to lay their views and objections, if
any, before the bishop and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners;
but their views need not necessarily be
accepted and their objections may be overruled.</p></div>

<a name="PNanchor_44" id="PNanchor_44"><span class = "pagenum">44</span></a><div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_14" id="SN_2_14"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_14"><span class="label">14</span></a>. An incumbent cannot hold more than one
benefice at the same time, except that upon a certificate
of the bishop as to the facts, and with a
licence or dispensation from the archbishop of
the province (from the refusal of which there is
an appeal to the King in Council), he may hold
a second, the church of which is within four miles
of that of the first by the nearest road, if the
annual value of one of the benefices does not
exceed the net sum of £200, after deducting
rates, taxes, tenths, dues, and permanent charges,
but not the stipend of a curate.  But where the
population of one of the parishes is over 3000,
the joint holding will only be lawful if that of
the other is under 500.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_15" id="SN_2_15"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_15"><span class="label">15</span></a>. The bishop is invested with certain specific
powers in case of the inadequate performance of the
ecclesiastical duties of a benefice, including not only
the regular and due performance of Divine service
on Sundays and holy days at the usual hours, but
also all such duties as the incumbent is bound
by law to perform, or the performance of which
was solemnly promised by him at his ordination,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
and the performance of which has been required
of him in writing by the bishop; and including
also, in the four Welsh dioceses and the county
of Monmouth, such ministrations in Welsh as the
<a name="PNanchor_45" id="PNanchor_45"><span class = "pagenum">45</span></a>bishop directs to be performed by him, not being
more than one service in Welsh on every Sunday
in any church, and without interfering with due
provision for the English-speaking portion of the
people. If the bishop has reason to believe that
these duties are inadequately performed by an
incumbent, he may issue a commission of inquiry
to four commissioners, viz. the archdeacon or
rural dean of the archdeaconry or deanery in
which the benefice is situate; the canon residentiary,
prebendary, or honorary canon of the
cathedral church of the diocese elected triennially
for the purpose by the dean and chapter; the
beneficed clergyman elected triennially for the purpose
by and out of the beneficed clergy of the
archdeaconry; and a lay justice of the peace of
the county nominated on the requisition of the
bishop by the chairman of quarter sessions or
lord-lieutenant of the county; and the incumbent
may, if he desires, add a beneficed clergyman of
the diocese or a justice of the peace as a fifth
commissioner. If the commissioners or a majority
of them report that the duties are inadequately
performed, the procedure may be different, according
as they do or do not add that this is due to
the negligence of the incumbent. If they do not
report negligence, the bishop has only power to
require the incumbent to nominate one or more
curates to perform or assist in performing the
duties, and to make the appointment himself if
<a name="PNanchor_46" id="PNanchor_46"><span class = "pagenum">46</span></a>the incumbent fails to do so, subject to an appeal
to the archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> But if they report negligence,
the bishop may make the appointment
without previously requiring the incumbent to
nominate, and may inhibit the incumbent from
performing all or any of the duties, subject to an
appeal by him to the tribunal constituted by the
Benefices Act, 1898.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Evidence given before the

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_16" id="SN_2_16"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_16"><span class="label">16</span></a>. An incumbent is ordinarily bound to reside
in his benefice, or in one of them if he holds two,
or in the parsonage or vicarage house (if any);<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
and, even though he keeps a curate, it is his duty,
unless excused for some valid reason by the
bishop, to read the prayers and administer the
sacraments at least once a month.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> If he is absent
in any year more than 90 days altogether, he is
liable to forfeit, by way of penalty, one-third;
if more than 180 days, one-half; if more than
240 days, two-thirds; and, if for the whole time,
three-fourths of the year's income of the benefice;
unless he has the bishop's licence, or if the bishop
has refused it, the archbishop's licence, for non-residence.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
This licence may be granted on
<a name="PNanchor_47" id="PNanchor_47"><span class = "pagenum">47</span></a>account of (i.) mental or physical infirmity; (ii.)
the dangerous illness of the incumbent's wife or
child residing with him (but in that case for six
months only, renewable from time to time by
leave of the archbishop on the recommendation of
the bishop); (iii.) the absence or unfitness of a
house of residence; (iv.) the occupation by the
incumbent of a house of his own in the parish,
provided he keeps the house of residence in good
repair.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Exceptions are made in favour of incumbents
holding certain official positions;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and the
bishop, with the sanction of the archbishop, may
grant a licence to reside outside the benefice, where
he thinks it expedient so to do. A licence for non-residence
is only valid until the 31st of December
in the year next after that in which it was granted;
and it may at any time be revoked, subject, in the
case of a bishop's licence, to an appeal to the
archbishop.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_17" id="SN_2_17"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_17"><span class="label">17</span></a>. In lieu of or after proceeding for pecuniary
penalties, the bishop may issue a monition and
order requiring a non-resident incumbent to
reside on and perform the duties of his benefice,
and in case of non-compliance with the order
may, subject to an appeal to the archbishop,
sequester the revenues of the benefice until residence
is resumed, and direct their application
in payment of the penalties, the expenses of
the monition and sequestration, the repair and
<a name="PNanchor_48" id="PNanchor_48"><span class = "pagenum">48</span></a>upkeep of the chancel, house of residence, and
other property of the benefice, the satisfaction of
any creditor's sequestration, and the augmentation

allowing, if he pleases, a certain proportion to the
incumbent.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> If a benefice continues for a year
under sequestration for non-residence or an
incumbent incurs two sequestrations for non-residence
within two years, and is not relieved
in respect of either on appeal, it becomes void as
if the incumbent were dead.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_18" id="SN_2_18"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_18"><span class="label">18</span></a>. The law also makes provision for the performance
of the ecclesiastical duties of a benefice
by curates in the case of an incumbent who does
not reside thereon for nine months in each year and
does not with the consent of the bishop perform
the ecclesiastical duties while residing on another
benefice of which he is the incumbent, or while
holding a licence not to reside on the benefice or
not to reside in the parsonage house thereof.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p></div>

bishop's licence cannot without the bishop's
permission resume the duties of their benefice
before the expiration of their licence; nor can
they, if non-resident for more than twelve
months, interfere during that period with the

as to non-residence, a month is a calendar month,
except where it is to be made up of an aggregate
of lesser periods, in which case thirty days are to

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_2_22" id="SN_2_22"></a><a href="#SNanchor_2_22"><span class="label">22</span></a>.  Resignation must be tendered to the bishop,
and unless made in view of an exchange must be
unconditional.  It should be made either in
person or by a deed attested by two witnesses.
The presence and attestation of a notary in
addition are usual but are not essential. The
resignation may be made at the request of the
bishop to avoid scandal and legal proceedings,
and he may agree to postpone the declaration of
the vacancy to a fixed date in the future in order
to enable the incumbent to receive the tithe rentcharge
accruing before that date. Its acceptance
by the bishop need not be signified in any particular
form or even in writing, and is implied if the
resignation was tendered at the bishop's request.
It cannot be revoked after its acceptance by the
bishop. Whether it can, under any circumstances,
<a name="PNanchor_50" id="PNanchor_50"><span class = "pagenum">50</span></a>be revoked previously to acceptance by him is
not clear.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> If, however, it is made for the purpose

induction of the other to the deceased's old
living, if that has taken place.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The Benefices
Act, 1898, precludes an incumbent, when he is

for resigning the benefice except under the
Clergy Resignation Bonds Act, 1828, sects. 1, 2,
which allow such an engagement with a view
to the appointment to the benefice, when
resigned, of a single specified individual whomsoever,
or of one of two specified individuals,
each of whom is by blood or marriage an uncle,
son, grandson, brother, nephew, or great-nephew
of the person or one of the persons entitled in

the patron or one of the patrons.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The corrupt
taking of any pension money or other benefit
for the resignation or exchange of a benefice is
prohibited by 31 Eliz. c. 6, s. 7.  But under
<a name="PNanchor_51" id="PNanchor_51"><span class = "pagenum">51</span></a>the Incumbents Resignation Acts, 1871 and 1887,
a pension may be awarded out of the revenue
of the benefice to an incumbent who, after a
continuous holding of the benefice for not less
than seven years, retires therefrom on the ground
of incapacity to perform the duties by reason of
permanent mental or bodily infirmity. The
bishop, if he thinks fit, on the representation
of the incumbent, appoints a commission to
inquire and report as to the expediency of the
resignation, and, if the majority of the commissioners
consider it expedient, as to the amount of
the pension; which must not exceed one-third of
the net annual value of the benefice, exclusive
of the house of residence. If the patron refuses
consent to the resignation, the question of its
acceptance is to be decided by the archbishop.
If the incumbent is a lunatic, found such by inquisition
or certificate of a master of lunacy, the
resignation may be carried out in his name by
the committee of his estate; but no provision
exists for effecting the resignation of an incumbent
of unsound mind, not so found. If any part
of the income of the benefice is derived from
tithe rentcharge or glebe lands, the pension is
to vary like the tithe rentcharge with the corn
averages; but it will not otherwise be affected
by a change in the value of the benefice.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It

and privileges of holy orders under the Clerical
Disabilities Act, 1870, or is admitted to another
benefice; and if he undertakes clerical duties for
a remuneration elsewhere than in the benefice
which he resigned, the bishop may decide that
his pension shall cease or be diminished altogether
or for a limited time; and the archbishop, on
appeal, may confirm, annul, or vary the bishop's
decision.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> A sum due from the retiring incumbent

sequestration for disobedience to the bishop's monition
or order requiring the incumbent to reside on
the benefice, or if he incurs two such sequestrations
within two years, and is not relieved as to either
of them on appeal;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> (v.) if an inhibition for

monition or order under the Public Worship
Regulation Act, 1874, remains in force for more
than three years, or a second inhibition for the
same purpose is issued within three years from
the relaxation of a former inhibition, and the
bishop does not intervene;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> or (vi.) in the case
of an incumbent presented or collated since 1898,
if within a year after his admission his benefice
is sequestrated on his bankruptcy or in aid of an
execution against his property, or if such a sequestration,
issued after that period, continues for a
year, or if he incurs two such sequestrations within

Moreover (vii.) the bishop is to declare a benefice
vacant if the incumbent is convicted of treason or
felony or, on indictment, of a misdemeanour, and is
sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour or
any greater punishment, or he has a bastardy order
made against him, or in a divorce or matrimonial
cause he is either found to have committed adultery
or an order for judicial separation is made against
him; but if, after being so convicted, he receives
a free pardon from the Crown before the benefice
is filled up, he is to be reinstated in it.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
(<i>b</i>) Sentence of deprivation is pronounced in suitable

<h3>UNBENEFICED CLERGY</h3>


<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_3_1" id="SN_3_1"></a><a href="#SNanchor_3_1"><span class="label">1</span></a>.  The unbeneficed clergy engaged in parochial
work may be divided into (i.) curates or ministers
in charge; (ii.) assistant licensed curates;
(iii.) unlicensed assistants; and (iv.) lecturers or
preachers. An unbeneficed clergyman has no
recognised legal status unless he obtains a licence
from the bishop of the diocese, for which the fee
is 10s.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> At the time of being licensed (unless,
having been ordained the same day, he has
already done so) he must make and subscribe the
Declaration of Assent prescribed by the Clerical
Subscription Act, 1865; and on the first Lord's
Day on which he officiates in the parish to which
he is licensed he must publicly repeat the same
declaration in the presence of the congregation
during Divine service.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Canon 48 requires that
before a curate or minister is permitted to serve
in any place he must be examined and admitted
by the bishop, having respect to the greatness
<a name="PNanchor_56" id="PNanchor_56"><span class = "pagenum">56</span></a>of the cure and the meetness of the party. Nor,
if he removes from one diocese to another, is he
to be admitted to serve without the testimony
of the bishop of that from which he came, as to his
honesty, ability, and conformity to the ecclesiastical
laws of the Church of England. But this
Canon gave no absolute right to stipendiary curates
to be admitted to serve after examination and
upon good episcopal testimony. They might,
notwithstanding, "be placed and displaced at the
bishop's discretion without any process at law."
He is under no obligation to grant a licence to
a curate, and cannot be compelled to do so.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It
is now, however, enacted, with respect to the
removal of curates, that the bishop, after giving
him sufficient opportunity of showing reason to
the contrary, may summarily revoke the licence
granted to any curate and remove him for any
cause which appears good and reasonable to the
bishop. But the curate may within one month
after service upon him of the revocation appeal
to the archbishop of the province, who may
confirm or annul the revocation as he thinks
proper.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_3_2" id="SN_3_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_3_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. Curates or ministers in charge are appointed
in a variety of cases. (<i>a</i>) If a benefice is vacant,
the sequestration of it is granted by the bishop to
<a name="PNanchor_57" id="PNanchor_57"><span class = "pagenum">57</span></a>the churchwardens or some one or more other
persons; and subject to the direction of the
bishop, if he gives any, the sequestrators are
charged with the selection of the person or
persons to serve the cure during the vacancy,
and the bishop may assign to him or them a
stipend not greater in the case of each than
at the rate of £200 per annum, and so that
the aggregate amount assigned do not exceed
the net annual income of the benefice.  The
sequestrators pay the costs of serving the cure
out of the revenue of the benefice, and account
for the balance to the succeeding incumbent,
upon whom on the other hand any deficiency
falls if these costs exceed the net revenue received
by the sequestrators.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> (<i>b</i>) Where under
the bankruptcy of the incumbent, or under a
judgment recovered against him, a benefice remains
under sequestration for six months, the
bishop from the expiration of the six months till
the close of the sequestration is to take order for
the services in the church of the benefice, and
may appoint and license for the purpose one or
more curates or additional curates to reside in and
serve the parish, subject to revocation at any
time, and with such stipends out of the revenue
of the benefice as he thinks fit within certain prescribed
<a name="PNanchor_58" id="PNanchor_58"><span class = "pagenum">58</span></a>limits according to the population of the
parish, and not exceeding in the whole two-thirds
of the annual value of the benefice.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> (<i>c</i>) Where an
incumbent is absent from his benefice for a period or
periods exceeding altogether three months in any
one calendar year, he must leave a curate or curates
licensed or approved by the bishop to perform the
ecclesiastical duties of the benefice. If he fails to
do so, or if after the death, resignation, or removal
of any such curate he does not within one month
notify the fact to the bishop, or does not within four
months nominate another proper curate to the
bishop, the bishop may appoint and license a
proper curate, with directions as to residence and
with a stipend according to a prescribed scale,
varying with the value of the benefice and the
population of the parish and the grounds of the
non-residence of the incumbent. A curate who is
appointed to serve in a benefice on which the incumbent
does not reside during four months in the
year is to be required by the bishop to reside within
the parish, or within three miles of the church of
the benefice, if no convenient residence can be
procured within the parish, except in cases of
necessity approved by the bishop. If the population
of the benefice exceeds 2000, the bishop
may require the incumbent to nominate two or
more curates, and, if this is not done, may
himself appoint them.  A scale of curates'
<a name="PNanchor_59" id="PNanchor_59"><span class = "pagenum">59</span></a>stipends where the incumbent is non-resident
is provided by law, varying according to the
annual value of the benefice and other circumstances,
and the bishop may direct that the
curate shall reside in the parsonage house.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
(<i>d</i>) Where a commission appointed to inquire into
the matter has reported that the ecclesiastical
duties of a benefice are inadequately performed
owing to the negligence of the incumbent, the
bishop may either require the incumbent to
nominate a curate or curates with sufficient
stipend to be licensed to perform or assist in
performing the duties, or may himself appoint a
curate or curates to perform all or any of the
duties, subject to an appeal to the court constituted
under the Benefices Act, 1898.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>  A
minister in charge has the rights and powers
of an incumbent in certain particulars, such as
the choice of a churchwarden, and, if the
benefice is vacant, but not if the incumbent is
bankrupt, the appointment of the parish clerk.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
(<i>e</i>) Where under the New Parishes Act, 1843, what
is called a Peel district is constituted, and a
minister is licensed to it by the bishop, he
<a name="PNanchor_60" id="PNanchor_60"><span class = "pagenum">60</span></a>occupies a somewhat ambiguous position during
the interval before it becomes a separate ecclesiastical
parish upon the consecration of a
church within its area. He is in many respects
in the position of a perpetual curate, being a
corporation sole, subject to the jurisdiction of the
bishop and archdeacon, and independent of the
incumbent of the parish so far as his licence
extends. But he has no power to take marriages
or burials, and the inhabitants of the district retain
their ecclesiastical position as parishioners of
the parish out of which the district is formed.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_3_3" id="SN_3_3"></a><a href="#SNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">3</span></a>. Assistant unbeneficed clergy are contemplated
by the canons, in which they are styled
curates; and with the licence of the bishop any
incumbent may employ one or more curates to
assist him in serving the parish. A curate
frequently comes in the first instance on probation
without being licensed, and his tenure of
office is then entirely dependent on the will of
the incumbent.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> But after he is licensed it
becomes more secure; and, in the meantime, if
a difficulty occurred about the remuneration
for his services, the law would give it to him
upon a <i>quantum meruit</i>. In order to obtain a
licence, the curate must present to the bishop
a declaration by the incumbent undertaking to
<a name="PNanchor_61" id="PNanchor_61"><span class = "pagenum">61</span></a>pay to him a specified annual sum as his stipend
and a declaration of his own intention to receive
the whole of that stipend; and the licence will
specify the amount of the stipend.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Any dispute
between an incumbent and a curate respecting
the curate's stipend is to be decided by the
bishop, who may enforce payment of it by
monition and sequestration of the benefice.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> If
the benefice becomes vacant, a curate must quit
upon six weeks' notice from the new incumbent, if
given within six months from the date of admission
to the benefice. But in other cases, unless the
bishop revokes his licence (see § 1 above), a curate
can only be required to quit after six months'
notice given by the incumbent with the previous
written permission of the bishop, or of the archbishop,
if the bishop refuses it and the archbishop
grants it upon an appeal to him within one
month after the bishop's refusal. On the other
hand, unless he obtains the express written consent
of the bishop, a curate before relinquishing
a curacy to which he has been licensed must give
three months' notice of his intention to the incumbent
and the bishop, upon pain of forfeiting
to the incumbent, as a debt retainable out of
his stipend or recoverable at law, such sum not
exceeding half a year's stipend as the bishop may
<a name="PNanchor_62" id="PNanchor_62"><span class = "pagenum">62</span></a>in writing direct.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Ordinarily, an incumbent
who is himself resident and performing the
duties of his cure has complete discretion whether
he will employ any, and, if so, how many curates,
and what duties shall from time to time be performed
by any whom he employs. But, besides
the cases of the incumbent's non-residence and
negligence in the performance of duties noticed
above (§ 2 (<i>c</i>), (<i>d</i>)), the bishop has power, if a
commission issued by him reports that the duties
of a benefice are inadequately performed, to require
the incumbent, although himself engaged
in performing them, to nominate an assistant
curate or curates; and, if he fails to do so within
three months, the bishop may himself appoint
one or more, as the case may require, with a
stipend proportionate to the value of the benefice
and the population of the parish. The
incumbent has an appeal to the archbishop, who
may confirm or amend the bishop's action.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
Moreover, where the annual value of a benefice
exceeds £500, and either the population amounts
to 3000, or there is a second church or chapel
with a hamlet containing 400 persons, the bishop
may require the incumbent to nominate an
assistant curate, and, on his failing to do so
<a name="PNanchor_63" id="PNanchor_63"><span class = "pagenum">63</span></a>within three months, may himself appoint one
with a stipend not exceeding £150; subject to
a similar appeal to the archbishop as in the case
where the duties have been inadequately performed.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_3_4" id="SN_3_4"></a><a href="#SNanchor_3_4"><span class="label">4</span></a>. An incumbent has an absolute discretion
as to permitting or refusing any other clergyman,
not being licensed as a curate to the parish,
to officiate within his parish, with this qualification,
that he has no right to permit any clergyman
to officiate in his parish who by law is
debarred from taking duty in the diocese. With
regard to this, no unbeneficed clergyman has,
strictly speaking, a right to officiate publicly in
a diocese, either in church or elsewhere, without
the licence or consent of the bishop, and his
doing so is an ecclesiastical offence.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But if the
bishop has not actually inhibited him from
officiating, a clergyman may take merely
temporary duty without obtaining the formal
licence of the bishop.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> If, without being either
beneficed or licensed to a curacy in the diocese,
he frequently takes duty therein, he should
obtain a general licence from the bishop for the
purpose. Canons 50 and 52 direct incumbents
and churchwardens not to suffer any one to preach
<a name="PNanchor_64" id="PNanchor_64"><span class = "pagenum">64</span></a>in their churches without showing his licence to
preach, and require the names of strangers who
preach with the date of their preaching and the
name of the bishop by whom they were licensed,
to be entered in a book for the information of
the bishop of the diocese.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_3_5" id="SN_3_5"></a><a href="#SNanchor_3_5"><span class="label">5</span></a>. In some parishes provision has been made
for the election or appointment of lecturers or
preachers for the sole purpose of delivering
lectures or preaching sermons. In any such
parish the bishop, if he thinks fit, with the assent
of the incumbent, may require the lecturer or
preacher to perform other ministerial duties as
assistant curate or otherwise, and may vary the
duties from time to time. If the duties so
prescribed are not performed, the defaulter may
be removed from his office.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p></div>

<h3>LAITY OF THE PARISH</h3>


<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_1" id="SN_4_1"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_1"><span class="label">1</span></a>. There is no general law as to the relations
between an incumbent and the lay officers of a
parish. They vary in ancient and in new ecclesiastical
parishes, and in particular places are
modified by custom.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_2" id="SN_4_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. The vestry in an ancient parish consists of
the ratepayers who are inhabitants of the parish
or who, though not residents therein, are rated
for the relief of the poor in respect of the parish,
and of occupiers of hereditaments so rated. A
meeting of the vestry is called by the incumbent
and churchwardens by a notice in print or
writing, and signed by the incumbent or a
churchwarden or overseer, and affixed on or near
the doors of all the churches and chapels in the
parish in which the service of the Church is
performed, on some Sunday at least three clear
days before the meeting is to be held.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The
<a name="PNanchor_66" id="PNanchor_66"><span class = "pagenum">66</span></a>incumbent is <i>ex officio</i> chairman of every vestry
meeting. In case of his absence, or of there
being no incumbent, the members of the vestry
present elect one of themselves as chairman. In
case of an equality of votes the chairman, as such,
has a casting vote in addition to his previous
right to vote as a member of the vestry.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In the
event of a poll being demanded, it is taken by
open voting, and the members of the vestry have
from one to six votes, according to the amount of
their assessment, those assessed at an annual
value of under £50 having one vote, and those
assessed at £50 and upwards having one vote for
every complete £25 of their assessment up to
£150; all at or above that figure having six
votes and no more. In a new ecclesiastical parish
or district a meeting in the nature of a vestry is
composed of the same persons as would, if the
parish or district were an ancient parish, be entitled
to vote in the vestry thereof. But the
Vestries Act, 1818,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> only applies to ancient parishes.
Consequently there is no plural voting in the quasi-vestry
of a new parish, nor need the notice summoning
a vestry meeting be given on a Sunday
three clear days before the meeting.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>  But in
<a name="PNanchor_67" id="PNanchor_67"><span class = "pagenum">67</span></a>other respects a vestry or a meeting in the nature
of a vestry in a new parish is regulated by the
same procedure as in an ancient parish. Since
the abolition of compulsory church rates in 1868,
and the transfer of their secular duties to other
bodies, the functions of these vestries or meetings,
whether in old or in new parishes, have been
for the most part confined to the election of
churchwardens and the approval, or the contrary,
of applications for faculties.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> In some places
under a local Act or by the adoption of the
Vestries Act, 1831,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the functions of the vestry
are exercised by a select vestry consisting of a
limited number of householders elected by the
parishioners.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_3" id="SN_4_3"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_3"><span class="label">3</span></a>. With regard to churchwardens, the general
law as to their appointment in ancient parishes
is declared by the 89th and 90th Canons. They
are to be chosen, if possible, by the joint consent
of the minister and parishioners. But if these
cannot agree upon the choice, the minister is to
choose one and the parishioners another. A stipendiary
curate being at the time in charge of
the cure stands in the place of the incumbent in
the choice of churchwardens.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The election is to
be annual, in Easter week; but the same persons
are re-eligible for any number of years. By
custom, however, there may be only one churchwarden
<a name="PNanchor_68" id="PNanchor_68"><span class = "pagenum">68</span></a>or more than two; and, as is the case
in the City of London, both may by custom be
elected by the parishioners, or by the lord of
the manor, or one by the incumbent and the
other by the outgoing churchwardens. The
election ordinarily takes place at the Easter
vestry, but an election at another time is valid.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The election of both churchwardens is the act of
the whole vestry, whether the minister and parishioners
agree in their choice, or the minister
chooses one and the parishioners the other. In
the latter alternative, therefore, the vote of the
minister is exhausted in choosing his own
warden, and he cannot also vote as a parishioner
in the election of the other warden; though if
there is an equality of votes in this election, he
apparently can, as chairman of the vestry, decide
it by a casting vote.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In the case of all churches
built under the Church Building or New Parishes
Acts, except those which have no district attached
to them, two churchwardens are to be annually
chosen at Eastertide, one by the minister and
the other by the persons entitled to attend and
vote at a meeting in the nature of a vestry for
the parish or district attached to the church.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> If
<a name="PNanchor_69" id="PNanchor_69"><span class = "pagenum">69</span></a>the church has no district attached to it, the
choice of the second warden is vested in the
pewrenters, or, if there are no rented pews, the
minister selects both wardens.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Churchwardens,
after their appointment, have no legal right to exercise
their office until they have been admitted by
the archdeacon at his visitation, or by the bishop
or his chancellor during the years of episcopal
visitation, when the archdeacon is inhibited and
cannot act. Till then, their predecessors remain
in office, notwithstanding that their year has expired,
and their successors have been appointed.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_4" id="SN_4_4"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">4</span></a>. The two churchwardens are sometimes
distinguished as the parson's or vicar's warden
and the people's warden. But there is no legal
precedence or seniority between the two, and
though chosen differently their duties are identical.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
These may be enumerated as follows:
(<i>a</i>) The care of the fabric of the church, with its
ornaments and furniture, and of the churchyard;
and the duty of keeping them in proper repair and
condition and of adequately insuring against fire
so far as funds are in hand for the purpose, except,
<a name="PNanchor_70" id="PNanchor_70"><span class = "pagenum">70</span></a>as regards the chancel, where the rector is liable
for its repair.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> They have no proprietary rights
in the church or its fixtures or in the churchyard,
but the movable articles in the church, including
the bells and bell-ropes, and sums of money given
to the church, belong to them as a corporation
for that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> (<i>b</i>) The seating of the
parishioners and other churchgoers in the church,
including the chancel, subject, however, as regards
the chancel of an old parish church, to the right
of the rector, whether spiritual or lay, and his
family, to the chief seat, and to his disposal of the
other chancel seats if the bishop or churchwardens
take no action respecting them. In this duty the
churchwardens act as the officers of the bishop,
and are subject to his control if any complaint is
made against them. Neither the vestry nor the
incumbent, nor any individual parishioner, can interfere
with their discretion in the matter, except
by appealing to the bishop. (<i>c</i>) The provision at
the expense of the parish of sacramental bread and
wine and a surplice for the minister, as required
by Canons 20 and 58. (<i>d</i>) The maintenance of
order in the church and churchyard during Divine
service. (<i>e</i>) The collection of the money at the
offertory, and concurrence with the minister in its
disposal to pious and charitable uses. (<i>f</i>) The
<a name="PNanchor_71" id="PNanchor_71"><span class = "pagenum">71</span></a>charge of the church and benefice and of providing
for the cure of souls during a vacancy in the living,
if, as is usually the case, they are appointed sequestrators,
but not otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Churchwardens can
neither add to, alter, or remove any part of the
church or its fittings without a faculty, nor can
they interfere with the clergyman in his ministrations
unless his conduct is such as to be riotous,
violent, or indecent within the meaning of the Act
of 1860 against brawling.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The rights and duties
of the incumbent on the one hand, and of the
churchwardens on the other, in respect of the
church and churchyard and the money and property
of the Church, are so interlaced, that on
many points friction cannot be avoided without
that harmonious co-operation which should always
exist between them, or, if this is unfortunately impossible,
at any rate without mutual forbearance
and concession.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_5" id="SN_4_5"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_5"><span class="label">5</span></a>. The 90th Canon directs that the minister
and parishioners in every parish, if they can
agree, shall yearly in Easter week choose two
or three or more discreet persons as sidemen (or,
as they are now called, sidesmen) to assist the
churchwardens in performing the duties of their
office. If no agreement is come to, they are to
be appointed by the bishop.  This Canon only
<a name="PNanchor_72" id="PNanchor_72"><span class = "pagenum">72</span></a>applies to ancient parishes, and therefore sidesmen
appointed, as is frequently the case, in new
ecclesiastical parishes have, strictly speaking, no
legal status. They are, however, frequently
treated as if they possessed it, and in these, as
well as in ancient parishes, assist the churchwardens
in seating the people and taking the
collections in church. No practical harm is likely
to result from this unless they undertook such a
duty as, for instance, the forcible ejection of a
person misbehaving in church, in which case their
right to do so might be called in question.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_6" id="SN_4_6"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_6"><span class="label">6</span></a>. In addition to the churchwardens a body
of Church trustees may now be appointed in any
parish to accept contributions and hold funds for
certain defined ecclesiastical purposes.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> They are
to consist of the incumbent and two householders
or owners or occupiers of land in the parish, chosen
in the first instance and on the happening of a
vacancy, one by the patron and the other by the
bishop, the incumbent being chairman. They are
a body corporate under the name of the Church
Trustees of the parish in which they are appointed,
<a name="PNanchor_73" id="PNanchor_73"><span class = "pagenum">73</span></a>with perpetual succession and a common seal, and
power to sue and be sued in their corporate name.
As circumstances from time to time require, they
may pay over funds in their hands to the churchwardens
to be applied to the defined ecclesiastical
purposes of the parish generally or to one or more
of them specifically, due regard being had to any
particular directions of the donors. Funds not
so paid over may be invested in government or
real securities and accumulated, with a view to the
capital or income being applied at a subsequent
time. At least once a year the trustees must lay
before the vestry all accounts and particulars of
their receipts and expenditure during the preceding
year, and of the balance of funds in their
hands.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_7" id="SN_4_7"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_7"><span class="label">7</span></a>. The appointment and duties of the parish
clerk vary in old and new parishes, and depend
in some cases on custom. In old parishes the
office is a freehold, and the right of appointment
usually rests with the incumbent, who can exercise
it even when the living is sequestrated owing
to his bankruptcy; but in case of his being under
suspension, it devolves on the curate in charge.
The right, however, may by custom belong to the
parishioners in vestry. An old writer compared
the parish clerk to a bat, as being half-bird, half-beast,
or half-clerical and half-lay, though he
considered that his clerical wings outbalanced
<a name="PNanchor_74" id="PNanchor_74"><span class = "pagenum">74</span></a>his lay body. But it is now held that the office
is temporal, and not spiritual.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> A person in
holy orders may, however, with the consent of
the bishop, be appointed parish clerk under the
Lecturers and Parish Clerks Act, 1844, and, if
so appointed, he is removable in the same way
as a stipendiary curate. The same Act provides
for the suspension or removal by the archdeacon,
of a parish clerk not in holy orders, who has
been guilty of neglect or misbehaviour in his
office, or of misconduct which renders him unfit
to hold it.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> In all new ecclesiastical parishes, on
the other hand, the appointment of the clerk
rests with the incumbent, and, in the case of
churches and chapels provided under the Church
Building Acts of 1818 and 1819, is made annually;
while in the case of those provided under
the New Parishes Acts of 1843, 1844, and 1856,
the clerk does not vacate his office at the end of
each year, but may at any time be removed by
the incumbent, with the consent of the bishop,
for misconduct.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_8" id="SN_4_8"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_8"><span class="label">8</span></a>. There is no universal rule as to the appointment,
duties, and tenures of office of the sexton or
sacristan. Where, in accordance with the etymology
<a name="PNanchor_75" id="PNanchor_75"><span class = "pagenum">75</span></a>of his name, his duties are confined to the
custody of the sacred vessels and vestments, the
care and cleaning of the church, the opening and
closing of the doors, and the ringing of the bells,
his appointment, in the absence of a contrary
practice, will naturally rest with the churchwardens.
Where, on the contrary, he has only
to do with the churchyard and grave-digging, his
appointment will be presumed to be in the hands
of the incumbent. If, however, he is charged with
both sets of functions, the incumbent and the
churchwardens jointly will be presumed to have
the right of appointing him. On the other hand,
in some few ancient parishes he is elected by the
vestry. The office may be held by a woman, and
in some places is a freehold for life; but usually
it is held during pleasure, and the power of removal
rests in the same hands as that of the
appointment.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In new ecclesiastical parishes the
sexton is to be appointed by the incumbent, and,
with the consent of the bishop, is removable by
him for misconduct.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_9" id="SN_4_9"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_9"><span class="label">9</span></a>. Another old parochial office was that of
beadle&mdash;the bidder, crier, or messenger of the
parish&mdash;whose duty was to attend in that capacity
<a name="PNanchor_76" id="PNanchor_76"><span class = "pagenum">76</span></a>on the incumbent, churchwardens, and vestry. His
position and duties were rather civil than ecclesiastical,
but the vestry could sanction his salary
being paid out of the church rate. He was also
frequently employed to keep order in the church
and churchyard during Divine service; and the
Church Building Act, 1831, enumerates the payment
of the salaries of beadles and pew-openers
as well as of the clerk, as one of the expenses
incidental to the performance of Divine service,
to be paid out of the rents of pews in churches
built under that Act.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_10" id="SN_4_10"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_10"><span class="label">10</span></a>. The organist and choristers, and any other
lay officials beyond those already mentioned, who
may be employed in or about the church or
churchyard, are under the exclusive control and
direction of the incumbent, and, as a rule, are
appointed by him. But in some parishes the
organist is, or was, when paid out of the church
rate, selected by the vestry. Whether he is
appointed by them or by the incumbent, his
office is not a freehold; but he as well as the
other officials now under consideration may be
dismissed from office on proper notice, the length
of which should be laid down at the time of
appointment. If no time is then fixed, the proper
length of notice may, in case of dispute, be a very
difficult question to decide. It will depend in
part on the terms of the engagement, and of the
salary.  If the salary be so much per month,
<a name="PNanchor_77" id="PNanchor_77"><span class = "pagenum">77</span></a>probably one month's notice of dismissal would
suffice. Not less than three months' notice would
be requisite if the salary is so much per quarter;
while if the salary is an annual sum, even this
notice might perhaps be insufficient. Whatever
be the mode of appointment and terms of the
engagement of the organist, the incumbent has,
within the bounds of legality, and so far as he
does not voluntarily surrender it, the absolute
right to control the use of the organ and the
performance of music in the church, both during
Divine service and at other times.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> But, unless he
is prepared to defray the cost out of his own
pocket, this right must, of course, in practice, be
limited by the extent to which the parishioners
or congregation are willing to give the necessary
financial support to his arrangements.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_11" id="SN_4_11"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_11"><span class="label">11</span></a>. The old rank of reader, which was formerly
one of the minor orders, was temporarily revived
after the Reformation to supplement the lack of
clergy, and seems to have been continued in some
remote districts till the close of the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> It has in recent times been resuscitated
as a lay office.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Moreover, the practice has
<a name="PNanchor_78" id="PNanchor_78"><span class = "pagenum">78</span></a>of late years increased of the lessons being read
in church by laymen at the request of the incumbent,
without the express sanction of the bishop.
But an incumbent ought not, without that sanction,
to permit a layman to take any other part
in any service in a consecrated building. The
officiating of a layman in an unconsecrated
building does not stand quite on the same footing;
but, as a matter of Church order and regularity,
the approval of it by the bishop should
be procured, through the layman being expressly
authorised as a lay reader, or in some other
manner, especially if the building is licensed for
Divine worship. All such laymen must, of course,
act with the consent, and under the direction, of
the incumbent of the parish.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_12" id="SN_4_12"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_12"><span class="label">12</span></a>.  Laymen and women engaged in less formal
kinds of parochial work (among which is the
visiting of the poor and sick contemplated by
Canon 13 as one of their occupations on Sundays
and other holy days) are responsible to the incumbent
alone, and should act with his permission
and under his directions. The Sunday
schools, with their superintendents and teachers,
are under his sole control. His powers with regard
to the religious instruction given in any
Church elementary school in the parish depend
upon the terms of the trust-deed or scheme (if
any) regulating the school, and upon the subsection
in the Education Act, 1902, that religious
<a name="PNanchor_79" id="PNanchor_79"><span class = "pagenum">79</span></a>instruction given in a public elementary school
not provided by the local authority shall, as
regards its character, be in accordance with the
provisions (if any) of the trust-deed relating thereto,
and shall be under the control of the managers;
provided that nothing in the subsection is to
affect any provision in a trust-deed for reference
to the bishop or superior ecclesiastical or other
denominational authority, so far as such provision
gives to the bishop or authority the power of
deciding whether the character of the religious
instruction is or is not in accordance with the
provisions of the trust deed.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_4_13" id="SN_4_13"></a><a href="#SNanchor_4_13"><span class="label">13</span></a>. Parochial church councils, where they exist,
like ruridecanal and diocesan conferences, rest at
present on a purely voluntary basis. Whatever,
therefore, may be their advantages, and however
desirable may be their incorporation into our
regular Church system, the parish clergy stand
as yet in no legal relation to them.</p></div>

<h3>DIVINE SERVICE</h3>


<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_5_1" id="SN_5_1"></a><a href="#SNanchor_5_1"><span class="label">1</span></a>. Every deacon and priest before his ordination,
and, as mentioned above, every incumbent,
before he is admitted to his benefice, and every
stipendiary curate, on entering upon his curacy,
declares that in public prayer and administration
of the sacraments he will use the form prescribed
in the Book of Common Prayer and none other
except so far as ordered by lawful authority.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
This uniform use is enjoined by the Acts of
Uniformity and the Prayer Book itself, which
has legal force as part of the Act of 1662, and
by the 14th Canon, except so far as modifications
are permitted under the Act of Uniformity
Amendment Act of 1872, which, like the Act
of 1662, was passed at the instance of Convocation.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
No clergyman, therefore, may alter, add
to, or diminish the form of worship therein
<a name="PNanchor_81" id="PNanchor_81"><span class = "pagenum">81</span></a>prescribed, including the lessons.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The expression
"lawful authority" occurs in the Act
of 1662, which directs that in those portions
of the Prayer Book which relate to the King,
Queen, or Royal progeny the names shall be altered
from time to time as occasion requires according
to the direction of lawful authority. This is
explained by Bishop Gibson to mean, according
to practice, the authority of the Sovereign in
Council.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The archbishops and bishops have no
authority, combined or singly, to order modifications
of or additions to the forms of Divine
service, except to the extent permitted by the
Act of 1872. The Preface to the Prayer Book
"Concerning the Service of the Church" expressly
contemplates that in lieu of diversity of use in
different dioceses and parts of the realm, all shall
henceforth have but one use. The only function
of the prelates which it recognises in the matter
is the power of the bishop to set at rest any
doubts which may arise as to the construction
of the Prayer Book and the proper practice thereunder,
with liberty to him, if he is himself in
doubt, to refer to the archbishop. But the
Act of 1872 permits (<i>a</i>) the use, upon a special
occasion approved by the ordinary, of a special
form of service approved by him, and containing
nothing except anthems or hymns, which does
<a name="PNanchor_82" id="PNanchor_82"><span class = "pagenum">82</span></a>not form part of the Holy Scriptures or Book of
Common Prayer, and also (<i>b</i>) the use, on any
Sunday or holy day, as supplementary to the services
prescribed by the Prayer Book, of an additional
form of service, approved by the ordinary as to
its form and mode of use, and containing no
portion of the Communion Service and nothing
except anthems or hymns which does not form
part of the Holy Scriptures or Book of Common
Prayer. The same Act authorises the use of a
shortened order for Morning or Evening Prayer
on any day except Sunday, Christmas Day, Ash
Wednesday, Good Friday, and Ascension Day;
and the use of the Morning Prayer, the Litany,
and the Communion Service, in varying order as
separate services,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and the saying of the Litany
after the third collect in Evening Prayer, without
prejudice to any legal powers vested in the
ordinary, and either with or without a sermon,
lecture, or homily; and also the preaching of a
sermon without being preceded by a service appointed
by the Prayer Book, provided that it be
preceded by a service authorised by the Act, or
by a collect from the Prayer Book with or without
the Lord's Prayer.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_5_2" id="SN_5_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_5_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. The Prayer Book contains an "Order for
Morning and Evening Prayer daily to be said
and used throughout the year"; and under the
<a name="PNanchor_83" id="PNanchor_83"><span class = "pagenum">83</span></a>prefatory heading "Concerning the Service of the
Church," it is directed that all priests and deacons
are to say daily the Morning and Evening Prayer
either privately or openly, not being let by sickness
or some other urgent cause. And the curate
who ministers in a parish church, being at home
and not being otherwise reasonably hindered, is
to say the same in the church, after summoning
the people by a bell to come and hear God's
word and pray with him. A bishop, however,
has no power to enforce daily services;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and
daily service has been held not to be requisite
under a trust to perform the service "in strict
and literal accordance with the order of the Book
of Common Prayer."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But the Act of Uniformity
of 1662, s. 1, expressly enacts that the morning
and evening prayers contained in that Book
shall, on every Lord's Day, and on all other
days and occasions, and at the times therein
appointed, be openly read by every minister or
curate in every church, chapel, or other place
of public worship.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> And the 14th and 15th
Canons direct that the Common Prayer shall be
said or sung distinctly and reverently upon such
<a name="PNanchor_84" id="PNanchor_84"><span class = "pagenum">84</span></a>days as are appointed to be kept holy by the
Prayer Book and their eves, and that the Litany
shall be said or sung when and as prescribed in
the Prayer Book; and in particular on Wednesdays
and Fridays weekly, though they be not
holy days, the minister at the accustomed hours
of service is to resort to the church and say the
Litany after warning the people by tolling a
bell. A later enactment empowers the bishop,
at his discretion, to order two full services (each,
if he so directs, to include a sermon or lecture)
on every Sunday throughout the year or any part
of the year in the church or chapel of any benefice,
whatever its annual value or population, and
also in certain cases where a benefice is composed
of more than one parish or chapelry, in the church
or chapel of each of them.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> And where he considers
that the population requires it, he may direct the
celebration on Sundays and the great festivals of a
third service, being either the Morning or Evening
Service with a third sermon, and for the performance
of this third service may insist on a
curate being nominated, whose salary is to be
provided by the pews being specially let for the
service or by subscription.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> It is rarely necessary

<a name="PNanchor_86" id="PNanchor_86"><span class = "pagenum">86</span></a>think fit; wherein if they disagree, it is
to be disposed of as the ordinary shall appoint.
Money collected at other times during Divine
service ought to be brought up to the minister to
be placed on the Holy Table, like the offertory
money; but, unlike this, it is under the sole control
and disposal of the incumbent; unless it is collected
for church expenses or repairs for which
the churchwardens are responsible, in which case
it should be handed over to them.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> And if the
purpose for which the collection is made is
announced beforehand, there is, of course, a legal
as well as moral obligation to apply the money
collected to that purpose. Offertory alms collected
in a chapel are at the disposal of the incumbent
and wardens of the parish church.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p></div>

clergy at the Holy Communion, as well as in other
ministrations, has been decided to be that laid
down by the Advertisements of 1566, which are
followed in Canons 24, 25, and 58, and prescribe
the wearing of a surplice with the proper hood
of the university degree (if any); except that in
cathedral and collegiate churches the celebrant
and gospeller and epistler shall wear copes. The
rubric of the First Prayer Book of Edward VI.,
had directed that the celebrant should wear a
white albe plain with a vestment (<i>i.e.</i> a chasuble)
or cope, and any assistant priests or deacons
should wear albes with tunicles.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Stoles, as distinguished

with two lighted candles on or above the table is
permissible.[192] The administration of the mixed
chalice is legal, but the wine and water must not be
ceremonially mixed during the service.[192] Wafers,
not consisting of bread "such as is usual to be

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_5_6" id="SN_5_6"></a><a href="#SNanchor_5_6"><span class="label">6</span></a>. No minister is to refuse or delay to christen
according to the form of the Book of Common
Prayer any child brought to him to the church
for that purpose on a Sunday or holy day, after
notice given to him overnight or in the morning
before the beginning of Morning Prayer. The
ceremony should take place immediately after the
second lesson at either Morning or Evening Prayer.
The congregation can then testify the receiving
of the newly baptized into the number of Christ's
Church, and all present are reminded of their own
profession made to God in their baptism. But if
necessity requires, children may be baptized on
any other day.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The law is the same as regards
children of Church people and of Dissenters, and
as regards legitimate and illegitimate children. If
a minister is duly informed of the weakness and
danger of death of an unbaptized infant in the
parish, and is desired to go and baptize him, he
must not refuse or so delay that the infant dies
<a name="PNanchor_92" id="PNanchor_92"><span class = "pagenum">92</span></a>through his fault unbaptized.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> But in every other
case a male child must have two godfathers and one
godmother, and a female child one godfather and
two godmothers; and a minister will, of course, not
admit as a sponsor a person notoriously leading an
immoral life or otherwise manifestly unfit for the
office. Godparents must have received the Holy
Communion, and a father cannot be godfather for
his own child.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> In 1865 the Canterbury Convocation,
with the Royal licence, framed a new canon repealing
this prohibition; but the canon was never
ratified by the Crown, nor was any similar canon
passed by the York Convocation. The Form for
the ministration of Private Baptism in houses contains
a service for the public reception in church,
as one of the flock of true Christian people, of a
child who, in case of emergency, has been baptized
at home, and also a formula of conditional baptism
to be substituted for the words of actual baptism
in cases where there is a doubt whether the
essential parts of the Sacrament were observed in
the private performance of the ceremony. The
rubrics direct immersion in the case of the public
baptism of infants, if the godparents certify that
the child can endure it, and affusion, if they certify
that the child is weak. Naturally, affusion alone
is directed in the case of private baptism. In the
case of the baptism of adults, immersion or affusion
are directed as alternatives, the discretion being
<a name="PNanchor_93" id="PNanchor_93"><span class = "pagenum">93</span></a>left with the minister and not with the godparents.
The rubric directs that, before adult persons are
to receive baptism, not less than one week's previous
notice shall be given to the bishop, or a person
appointed by him, by the parents or some other
discreet persons, in order that due care may be
taken for their examination as to their knowledge
of the principles of the Christian religion, and that
they may be exhorted to prepare with prayers
and fasting for the reception of that holy Sacrament.
The baptismal services throughout contemplate
the performance of the ceremony by a
priest; but in the Form of Making of Deacons a
deacon is expressly authorised to baptize infants
in the absence of the priest. Lay baptism is valid
in case of emergency; but, of course, a layman is
not at liberty to use the baptismal service.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_5_7" id="SN_5_7"></a><a href="#SNanchor_5_7"><span class="label">7</span></a>. The Holy Communion is to be administered
in every parish church and chapel so often and at
such times as that every parishioner may communicate
at least twice in the year (whereof the
feast of Easter shall be one).<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Warning is to be
given to the parishioners "publicly in church at
Morning Prayer" on the Sunday before every time
of administering the Holy Communion,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and the
present rubric requires that so many as intend
to be partakers of the Sacrament shall signify
their names to the curate, meaning the incumbent,
at least some time the day before. In the First
<a name="PNanchor_94" id="PNanchor_94"><span class = "pagenum">94</span></a>Prayer Book of Edward VI. this rubric ran: "So
many as intend to be partakers of the Holy Communion
shall signify their names to the curate overnight
or else in the morning afore the beginning
of Matins or immediately after."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The incumbent
must not deny the Sacrament, without lawful
cause, to any person that devoutly and humbly
desires to receive it.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> But he is directed both
by the Canons and by the rubric to repel from
Communion, until repentance, open and notorious
evil livers, and those who have wronged their
neighbours by word or deed so as to offend
the congregation, and those between whom he
perceives malice and hatred to reign. The Canons
add to the list common and notorious depravers
of the Book of Common Prayer, or the Ordering
of Bishops and Priests, or the Thirty-nine Articles,
<a name="PNanchor_95" id="PNanchor_95"><span class = "pagenum">95</span></a>or depravers of the sovereign authority of the
King in causes ecclesiastical, and those who refuse
to kneel when receiving the Communion or to be
present at public prayers according to the order
of the Church of England. When any one is so
repelled, the incumbent must report the matter to
the ordinary within fourteen days, or sooner if
required by the offending person or by the ordinary
himself, and must obey his order and direction in
reference to it. The rubric directs that the ordinary
shall proceed against the offender according
to the Canon, that is to say, by such ecclesiastical
censures and punishments as can be inflicted.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In
Jenkins <i>v.</i> Cook<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> the meaning of a "common
and notorious depraver of the Book of Common
Prayer" was discussed, and the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council held that it did not include
a person who omitted certain parts of the Bible
from his family reading because he held them, in
their generally received sense, to be incompatible
with religion or decency. But while they assumed
that being a depraver of the Prayer Book would
be as valid a cause for denying Communion as
being an open and notorious evil liver, they  <ins class = "mycorr" title ="did did">did</ins>
not actually decide whether the Canons, which
do not as such bind the laity, can of their own
authority prescribe causes, sufficient or lawful, for
<a name="PNanchor_96" id="PNanchor_96"><span class = "pagenum">96</span></a>,denying Communion within the meaning of the
Act of 1547.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> It would not be expedient in the
present day for an incumbent, under Canons 28
and 57, to refuse the Communion to persons merely
because they came from outside his parish to communicate
in his church instead of in their own
parish church. Nor can he lawfully refuse it to
a person who occasionally attends or even communicates
in a dissenting place of worship.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The
question of admitting to Communion persons who
have been baptized in another communion or
Christian body, and have not been confirmed in the
Church of England, is one of more difficulty. The
rubrics in the Communion Office itself are silent on
the subject. But the exhortation at the close of
the Public Baptism of Infants directs that the child
shall be brought to the bishop to be confirmed
without delay after a sufficient course of instruction.
The rubric at the close of the Baptismal
Service for Adults declares the expediency of every
person so baptized being confirmed by the bishop
with all convenient speed after baptism, that so
he may be admitted to the Communion; and the
rubric at the end of the Order of Confirmation
prescribes that there shall none be admitted to
the Communion until such time as he be confirmed,
or be ready and desirous to be confirmed. These
rubrics must be read together, and are clearly
<a name="PNanchor_97" id="PNanchor_97"><span class = "pagenum">97</span></a>framed with a view to persons baptized in the
Church of England. In fact the Prayer Book nowhere
contemplates the case of a person who, having
been validly baptized in another communion or
body, afterwards joins the Church of England, or
the case of a person belonging to some other communion
who, while temporarily resident in England,
desires, without forsaking his own communion,
to communicate with his fellow Christians of our
Church. As the rubrics stand, such persons, unless
and until actually confirmed, have no right to
require a clergyman to admit them to Communion,
and he commits no legal offence by refusing to do
so. On the other hand, a considerable number of
such persons do, as a matter of fact, communicate
in our Church without having been confirmed or
being desirous to be confirmed; and a clergyman
who admits them, in the absence of any direction
of the bishop to the contrary,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> may be acting in a
wise and Christian manner.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_5_8" id="SN_5_8"></a><a href="#SNanchor_5_8"><span class="label">8</span></a>. The rubrics of the Communion Office prescribe
that a sermon or one of the authorised
homilies shall follow the Nicene Creed whenever
that portion of the office is used, whether a
Communion actually takes place afterwards or
<a name="PNanchor_98" id="PNanchor_98"><span class = "pagenum">98</span></a>not. And the 45th Canon enjoins the preaching
of one sermon every Sunday of the year. The
power of the bishop to require a second and
even, in certain cases, a third sermon has already
been noticed.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> But, inasmuch as the Prayer Book
contains no direction that sermons shall follow
Matins or Evensong, such sermons may be regarded
as in the nature of separate or additional
services. The 55th Canon prescribes that all sermons,
lectures, and homilies shall be preceded by
what is called the Bidding Prayer and the Lord's
Prayer. But this rule is not in practice observed
in the case of sermons in the middle of the Communion
Service or immediately following some
other service. Under the Act of Uniformity
Amendment Act of 1872, Morning and Evening
Prayer, the Litany, and Holy Communion may
any of them be used with or without the preaching
of a sermon or lecture or the reading of a
homily; and a sermon or lecture may be preceded
either by one of the services appointed by the
Prayer Book or by a service authorised by that
Act, or by a Collect taken from the Prayer Book,
with or without the Lord's Prayer.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p></div>

Canons and by the Prayer Book. But the direction
in the 59th Canon, that it shall take place for half-an-hour
or more before Evening Prayer, is superseded
by the rubric at the end of the Catechism,
<a name="PNanchor_99" id="PNanchor_99"><span class = "pagenum">99</span></a>which requires the incumbent of every parish
diligently upon Sundays and holy days, after the
second lesson at Evening Prayer, openly in the
church to instruct and examine so many children
of his parish sent to him as he shall think convenient,
in some part of the Catechism.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_5_10" id="SN_5_10"></a><a href="#SNanchor_5_10"><span class="label">10</span></a>. The Churching of Women is regulated by
the rubrics at the commencement and close of the
service for the occasion in the Prayer Book. It
is contemplated as the first service in which a
woman takes part after recovery from childbirth;
but no specific time is prescribed for it beyond
the recommendation that she should receive the
Holy Communion if there be a Communion. In
former times a woman was not to be churched
after an illegitimate birth unless she had previously
done penance or acknowledged her fault
before the congregation at the time of her churching.
Since penance has fallen into disuse, a
clergyman must exercise his own discretion in
such cases; but he will, of course, neither church
nor admit to Communion a woman who impenitently
continues a sinful life. The rubric directs
that "accustomed offerings" shall be offered
at a churching, but their amount is not regulated
by any general or well-established rule.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p></div>

the incumbent or minister of the church of an
ancient or new ecclesiastical parish, or of a church
or chapel specially authorised for the publication
of banns and solemnisation of marriages, is bound,
in the case of persons who are legally competent
to be married in that church or chapel, to publish
or permit the publication of banns and solemnise
or permit the solemnisation of marriage, either
after due publication of banns or under a licence
from the bishop or the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and he may consent to the solemnisation
of the marriage upon a proper registrar's certificate.
If he improperly refuses publication of
banns or solemnisation of marriage, it is an
ecclesiastical offence for which he is liable to be
punished under the Clergy Discipline Act, 1840,
but it is a question whether he would be liable
to a civil action or an indictment for the refusal.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
On the other hand, a clergyman who knowingly

building or outside the lawful hours
(unless under special licence from the Archbishop
of Canterbury), or without due publication of
banns (unless under licence from him or from
the bishop, or upon a proper registrar's certificate),
will be guilty of felony; and a marriage solemnised
with the knowledge of the parties thereto elsewhere
than in an authorised building or without
publication of banns or the registrar's certificate,
unless with a sufficient licence, will be void.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></div>

Where the church of a parish is pulled down

of an adjoining parish; or, if there is a consecrated
chapel within the parish, the bishop may
direct that they shall take place within that
chapel, and may, with the consent of the incumbent,
give directions respecting the fees. Licences
for marriages in the church of the parish are to
be construed as licences for marriages in the

A Christian and a non-Christian may be married

is fourteen for the husband and twelve for the
wife. In the case of minors the consent of parents
or guardians is necessary to their marriage after
banns. In the case of the marriage by licence of a
minor who is not a widower or widow, the consent
to the marriage must be obtained from the
father if living, and if he is dead, from some one
guardian of the minor (if any). The mother,
whether still a widow or remarried, is by law a
guardian of the minor unless she has been removed
from the office by the High Court of
Justice. If she has been so removed and she
remains a widow, and there is no guardian in
existence, her consent to the marriage is necessary.
Where no requisite consenting party is in existence,
the marriage may be solemnised without consent.
If the father, mother, or other guardian
is of unsound mind, or abroad, or unreasonably
withholds consent, the Lord Chancellor or some
other Chancery judge may on petition make

them to marry again after the time for appealing
against the decree has expired, or after the
marriage has, on appeal, been declared to be
dissolved, in like manner as if the marriage had
been dissolved by death. A person divorced in
England has, therefore, a legal right to require his

solemnised in church in like manner as if he or
she were a widower or widow, with the exception
that no clergyman is by law bound to marry
a person whose marriage has been dissolved on
account of the person's own adultery; but in
case of his refusal to do so he must permit any
other clergyman willing to perform the ceremony
to use his church for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> In the banns

person whose divorce elsewhere than in England
is valid according to English law, it would seem
that although he or she can legally remarry in
England, yet a clergyman is under no legal obligation
to publish the banns or perform the ceremony
or permit it to be performed in his church.
The practice as to granting marriage licences in the

England according to English law between
foreigners, or between a foreigner and a British
subject, are valid throughout the British Empire,
these marriages will not necessarily be valid in
countries to which the foreigners belong, unless
the legal requirements of these countries are complied
with. Under arrangements made with
France and Belgium, the French Consul and
the Belgian Minister respectively will, on application,
ascertain in any particular case that
the legal requirements of their country have
been complied with, and will furnish a certificate
to that effect. No similar arrangement has
as yet been made with any other foreign State.
The following instructions have therefore been
issued in the diocese of London, and may, with
advantage, be observed elsewhere, namely:&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
Where both parties to an intended marriage
are foreigners, or one of them is a foreigner of
<a name="PNanchor_108" id="PNanchor_108"><span class = "pagenum">108</span></a>any nationality except French or Belgian, or is a
foreigner without a permanent residence in England,
the marriage should in all cases be by
licence, which will only be granted if the chancellor
of the diocese is satisfied that the law of
the country, to which the foreigners concerned
belong, is complied with.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> (<i>b</i>) Where a foreigner
of French or Belgian nationality, whose permanent
residence is in England, is a party to an
intended marriage after banns with an English
subject, the incumbent of the parish should require
before solemnising it the production of a certificate
from the French Consul or Belgian Minister, as
the case may be, that all the legal requirements
necessary to the recognition of the marriage as
valid in France or Belgium have been complied with.</p></div>

the rubrics in the Prayer Book, banns must be
published on three Sundays (without an alternative

(instead of after the Nicene Creed) in morning

morning service,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> according to the form of words
prescribed by the rubric. A slight deviation
from this form will not invalidate the publication.
A clergyman is not obliged to publish banns,
unless the parties, at least seven days before the
time required for the first publication, deliver or
cause to be delivered to him a notice in writing
bearing the date of the delivery, and setting forth
their true Christian names and surnames, and
the house or houses of their respective abodes

it, and, without due inquiry, publishes banns

render the marriage void. But where a party
has abandoned his baptismal and family names
and is known by repute by different names, his
banns ought to be published in his acquired

furnished by the Registrar-General to the incumbent
of every church or chapel in which
marriages may be solemnised; and it is the duty
of every clergyman who solemnises a marriage
<a name="PNanchor_118" id="PNanchor_118"><span class = "pagenum">118</span></a>to enter immediately afterwards in duplicate in
two of the books the prescribed particulars of
the marriage; and the entry is to be signed by
him and by the parties married and by two
witnesses. An incumbent is to allow searches
in all marriage register books in his custody at
a fee of 1s. for one year and 6d. for every
additional year to which the search extends, and
2s. 6d. for a certificate (besides 1d. for the stamp).
In every January and succeeding third month he
must send in to the superintendent registrar of
births, deaths, and marriages for the district,
either directly or through a subordinate registrar,
a certified copy of all the entries made by him
since his last return, and will receive 6d. for every
such entry. And whenever a register book is
filled, he is to send one copy to the same registrar
and keep the other copy with the registers of
baptisms and burials of his parish or chapelry.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p></div>

themselves for Holy Communion as married, a
clergyman has no right, (<i>a</i>) in the absence of any
ground for suspicion to the contrary, to demand
proof of their marriage before admitting them,
or (<i>b</i>) to refuse to admit them on a mere suspicion
that they are not married and therefore living in

prepared to show either (<i>a</i>) that they actually
<a name="PNanchor_119" id="PNanchor_119"><span class = "pagenum">119</span></a>are not married, or (<i>b</i>) that he had good grounds
for believing this to be the case. He is bound
to recognise as man and wife persons who have
been duly married according to the law affecting
them at the time of the marriage, whether ecclesiastically
or civilly, and whether in this country
or elsewhere; provided that the law was Christian
and monogamous; for a marriage according to
a law, custom, or rite which contemplates polygamous
unions is void in our law.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> If there is
any doubt as to the validity of their marriage, he
will always be on the safe side in adopting the
affirmative view and acting upon the assumption
of their being validly married. In the absence
of evidence to the contrary, the law will presume
a valid marriage from the fact of long reputation
and cohabitation as man and wife, without actual
proof of the ceremony having taken place.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> A

country if solemnised without banns or licence
in the presence of a clergyman of the Church

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_7_9" id="SN_7_9"></a><a href="#SNanchor_7_9"><span class="label">9</span></a>. Owing to the insufficiency of existing burial
accommodation and the importance of closing
churchyards in the centres of large towns, a series
of Burial Acts, together with an Act known as
the Public Health (Interments) Act, 1879,<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> have
been passed from 1852 onwards, enabling burial
boards and other local authorities to provide
burial grounds. The Acts contemplate that parts
of these grounds shall be consecrated and parts
remain unconsecrated, and the earlier Acts contemplated
<a name="PNanchor_129" id="PNanchor_129"><span class = "pagenum">129</span></a>the erection of chapels on each of these
parts. But questions having arisen as to the
amount of discretion possessed by a local burial
authority with regard to procuring the consecration
of any and what portion of a burial
ground acquired by them, an Act was passed in
1900 which, after authorising burial authorities
to apply to the bishop for the consecration of
any part of their burial ground approved by the
Home Secretary, added that if a burial authority
do not so apply within a reasonable time after
being requested to apply, and the Home Secretary
is satisfied that a reasonable number of persons
within the burial district desire that a portion of
the ground be consecrated, and that the consecration
fees have been paid or reasonably secured,
he may himself apply to the bishop for the consecration
of an approved portion of the ground, and
the bishop may consecrate it, and the burial
authority will be bound to make the necessary
arrangements for the consecration.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> And with
regard to chapels, burial authorities are empowered
to erect at their own cost, on any part
of their burial ground not consecrated or set
apart for a particular denomination, a chapel for
the joint common use of all denominations. They
may also, at the request and cost of residents
within the burial district of a particular denomination,
erect and maintain a chapel for the funeral
<a name="PNanchor_130" id="PNanchor_130"><span class = "pagenum">130</span></a>services of that denomination on ground appropriated
for their use. If a burial authority fail to
do this within a reasonable time after the request
has been made and the cost has been tendered or
adequately secured, the Home Secretary may, if he
thinks fit, order and compel the burial authority
to erect and maintain the chapel or give facilities
for its being done.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Where a burial ground has

Burial Acts, the incumbents, clerks and sextons,

has been provided, had, in respect of the burial of
inhabitants of those parishes in the consecrated
part of the ground, the same right to fees as they
had in the churchyard for which the ground is
substituted, or would have had in that churchyard
if it had been the parochial burying place
for their respective parishes.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> And the burial

grounds was considerably modified by the Burial
Act, 1900. Under this Act (i.) burial authorities
are to submit to the Home Secretary for his
approval, either with or without modification, a
table of fees to be received by them (of the same
amount in the consecrated and unconsecrated
parts of their burial ground) in respect of services
rendered by any minister of religion or
sexton; and if an authority fails to submit a

The fees are to be collected by and payable to the

were paid in a burial ground attached to or used
for the purposes of a parish, the like fees are to
continue payable during the incumbency of the
then incumbent or during fifteen years from that
date, whichever is the longer period, or if they
were not paid to the incumbent or to a person
claiming through him, then during fifteen years
from that date; and the burial authority are to
collect and pay them in like manner as fees for services
rendered; and (<i>b</i>) the Ecclesiastical Commissioners
may, at the request and with the approval
of the incumbent or other interested person, agree
with a burial authority for a periodical or other
payment in commutation of the fees other than
for services rendered; and where the fees are paid
to an incumbent or a person claiming through
him, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are to apply
the commutation money in the first instance in
compensating the existing incumbent, and the
residue in augmenting the benefice. (iii.) No fee
other than fees payable to a sexton for services
rendered by him, is to be paid to any clerk or
other ecclesiastical officer in respect of interments
in the ground of a burial authority; except that
a clerk or other ecclesiastical officer who, on 10th
July 1900, was entitled to fees in respect of interments
in any such ground, might apply to the
burial authority for compensation for their abolition,
<a name="PNanchor_133" id="PNanchor_133"><span class = "pagenum">133</span></a>and they were to pay him such equitable
amount of compensation as might be agreed upon

<h3>PRIVATE MINISTRATIONS</h3>


<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_8_1" id="SN_8_1"></a><a href="#SNanchor_8_1"><span class="label">1</span></a>. The only private ministration for which detailed
directions are provided in the Prayer Book
(other than Private Baptism, which has been already
noticed in Ch. V. § 6) is the Visitation of
the Sick with the Communion of the Sick in
appropriate cases. With reference to this the
67th Canon directs that when any person is dangerously
sick in the parish, the minister or curate
having knowledge thereof shall resort to the sick
person (if the disease is not known or reasonably
suspected to be infectious) to administer instruction
and comfort according to the order of
the Communion Book if he be no preacher; or if
he be a preacher, then as he shall think most
needful and convenient. And when any one is
passing out of this life a bell is to be tolled, and
the minister shall not then be slack to do his
duty. The Order for the Visitation contains
several alternative forms to suit different circumstances.
Among these is the provision for confession
and absolution. The minister is in all
cases to examine the sick person whether he
<a name="PNanchor_136" id="PNanchor_136"><span class = "pagenum">136</span></a>repent him truly of his sins and be in charity
with all the world, and is to exhort him to forgive
from the bottom of his heart all who have offended
him. This direction does not contemplate any
confession either particular or general, except so
far as profession of repentance involves admission
of sins to be repented of. But the minister is
further to move the sick person to make a special
confession of his sins if he feel his conscience
troubled with any weighty matter; and after this
confession, if he humbly and heartily desires it,
the priest is to pronounce a prescribed form of
absolution. It appears, therefore, that confession
is only contemplated if the sick person's conscience
is troubled with some weighty matter, and absolution
is only to be pronounced if (<i>a</i>) there has
been confession, and (<i>b</i>) the sick person desires it.
Communion of the sick may take place either
along with or apart from the visitation. In
either case there must be three, or at least two,
in addition to the minister, to communicate with
him, except in time of plague or similar contagious
illness, when the minister may communicate
with the sick person alone. In every case
he must receive the Communion himself first, and
then administer to the sick person's friends, and
to the sick person last. After a special Collect,
Epistle, and Gospel, the Order of Holy Communion
is to be followed from the words "Ye that do truly
and earnestly repent you of your sins" onwards.
<a name="PNanchor_137" id="PNanchor_137"><span class = "pagenum">137</span></a>The Church of England at present permits no
administration of any reserved Sacrament to the
sick nor any further abbreviation of the service.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
If the sick person is too ill to receive the Communion
in the prescribed way, or is otherwise
impeded, he is to be instructed that, without
doing so with his mouth, he eats and drinks the
Body and Blood of Christ to his soul's health if
he truly repents of his sins, and steadfastly and
thankfully believes in the redemption wrought by
Christ's death on the Cross for him.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_8_2" id="SN_8_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_8_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. The Prayer Book requires the incumbent of
every parish to bring or certify in writing to
the bishop all persons within the parish whom
he thinks fit to be presented to the bishop for
confirmation. No special mode of preparation
for that rite is prescribed beyond public instruction
<a name="PNanchor_138" id="PNanchor_138"><span class = "pagenum">138</span></a>in the Catechism (see above, Ch. V. § 9).
But this <i>minimum</i> is rightly in the present day
not considered sufficient. Special confirmation
classes and private interviews with intending
confirmees are now almost universal, and form
one of the most responsible and important parts
of the pastoral duties of the clergy.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_8_3" id="SN_8_3"></a><a href="#SNanchor_8_3"><span class="label">3</span></a>. Besides the ordinary occasions of Confirmation
and Sickness, the minister may be called
upon to give spiritual advice or comfort to persons
whom he knows to be living evil lives or
to be at enmity with their neighbours, or who are
troubled in conscience about coming to Holy
Communion, or generally about their spiritual
state. In the first Prayer Book of Edward VI.
the Exhortation to be said in giving previous
notice of Holy Communion where the people
were negligent in coming to it, contained injunctions
to reconciliation and charity among
neighbours and restitution of wrongs, without
which "neither the absolution of the priest can
anything avail them nor the receiving of this holy
sacrament doth anything but increase their damnation."
And it then referred to confession and
absolution in these terms:&mdash;</p></div>

<blockquote><p>"And if there be any of you whose conscience is
troubled and grieved in anything lacking comfort or
counsel, let him come to me or to some other discreet and
learned priest taught in the law of God, and confess and
open his sin and grief secretly, that he may receive such
<a name="PNanchor_139" id="PNanchor_139"><span class = "pagenum">139</span></a>ghostly counsel, advice, and comfort that his conscience
may be relieved, and that of us (as of the ministers of God
and of the Church) he may receive comfort and absolution
to the satisfaction of his mind and avoiding of all scruple
and doubtfulness: requiring such as shall be satisfied with
a general confession not to be offended with them that do
use, to their further satisfying, the auricular and secret
confession to the priest; nor those also which think needful
or convenient, for the quietness of their own consciences,
particularly to open their sins to the priest, to be
offended with them that are satisfied with their humble
confession to God and the general confession to the
Church: but in all things to follow and keep the rule of
charity, and every man to be satisfied with his own conscience,
not judging other men's minds or consciences
where as he hath no warrant of God's word to the same."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the present Prayer Book, all allusion to
"auricular" confession is omitted. The minister
simply exhorts that if any person cannot by his
own confession to God, with full purpose of
amendment of life and by reconciliation with
any neighbours whom he may have offended, quiet
his own conscience with a view to receiving Holy
Communion, he should come to the incumbent of
the parish, or to some other discreet and learned
minister of God's word, and open his grief, "that
by the ministry of God's holy word he may receive
the benefit of absolution together with ghostly
counsel and advice to the quieting of his conscience
and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness."
The procedure is clearly contemplated as exceptional,
<a name="PNanchor_140" id="PNanchor_140"><span class = "pagenum">140</span></a>as respects (<i>a</i>) the persons who have recourse
to it, (<i>b</i>) the occasions on which they do so,
and (<i>c</i>) the sins or stumbling-blocks on which
they consult the minister.</p>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_8_4" id="SN_8_4"></a><a href="#SNanchor_8_4"><span class="label">4</span></a>. In addition to these more formal ministrations,
a diligent clergyman will pay frequent
visits to his parishioners, and hold interviews or
correspondence with them on any questions of
intellectual perplexity or of practical difficulty
in their daily life in reference to which they
may desire his counsel or assistance; but his
action in these matters is not regulated by law,
and lies outside the scope of the present treatise.</p></div>

<h3>TEMPORALITIES</h3>


<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_1" id="SN_9_1"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_1"><span class="label">1</span></a>. The legal possessions and revenues of the
benefice of an ancient parish consist of (i.) the
church and churchyard (subject to the use of
both for the benefit of the people), (ii.) the parsonage
house and glebe lands and buildings, (iii.)
the tithe, (iv.) any modern endowments, including
perpetual annuities granted by the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, (v.) ordinary dues and offerings,
(vi.) mortuaries, and (vii.) fees; and some of these
possessions and revenues are also attached to the
benefice of a new ecclesiastical parish, which
has, moreover, in certain cases a further source
of revenue in (viii.) pew-rents.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_2" id="SN_9_2"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_2"><span class="label">2</span></a>. The incumbent for the time being, whether
of an ancient or new parish, has a freehold interest
for his life, if he so long remains incumbent,
in the possessions of the benefice, and for the
purpose of holding them is a corporation sole,
with a continuous succession in himself and all
future incumbents. As such, he is subject to the
general laws respecting corporations, and also to
those which regulate the acquisition and holding
<a name="PNanchor_142" id="PNanchor_142"><span class = "pagenum">142</span></a>of landed property for charitable purposes,
except so far as the law has made special exemptions
in his favour. Accordingly, except to
the extent expressly permitted by statute, he
cannot in his corporate capacity, with perpetual
devolution to his successors in office, (<i>a</i>) acquire or
hold additional landed property without a licence
in mortmain or in a manner inconsistent with
the provisions of the Mortmain and Charitable
Uses Acts, 1888 and 1891,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> or (<i>b</i>) hold landed
property upon any trust or for any purpose other
than as part of the possessions of the benefice.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_3" id="SN_9_3"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_3"><span class="label">3</span></a>. The rights of an incumbent in the church
and churchyard differ according as the benefice
<a name="PNanchor_143" id="PNanchor_143"><span class = "pagenum">143</span></a>is an ancient or a new parish, and in the former
case according as it is a rectory or a vicarage.
The freehold of the whole church in an ancient
parish (except where a chapel or aisle or a pew
belongs to a private individual), and of the
churchyard, belongs to the rector, whether he be
the incumbent or not;<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and the chancel is repairable
by him, except where there is a custom
for the parishioners to keep it in repair. His
duty in this respect can be enforced by suit in
the ecclesiastical court, and the churchwardens
cannot safely repair the chancel themselves and
then sue him for the cost.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> But the incumbent
and churchwardens (subject to the rights of the
bishop) have the possession and custody of the
whole church, including the chancel, and a lay
rector cannot interfere with their proper use of
it; nor can any person claim to enter it, when
not open for Divine service, without their permission.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
And the incumbent has the paramount
right to keep the keys of the church and to
control the use of the organ and the ringing of
the bells.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> But ringers are not liable to criminal
proceedings in the ecclesiastical court for ringing
<a name="PNanchor_144" id="PNanchor_144"><span class = "pagenum">144</span></a>the church bells without his consent, unless it
was done against his express desire.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Moreover,
Canon 88 contemplates that the churchwardens
and sidesmen should have some control over the
bellringing; for it enjoins upon them not to
allow the bells to be rung superstitiously upon
holy-days or eves abrogated by the Prayer Book,
nor at any other times without good cause to
be allowed by the incumbent and by themselves.
And as regards the churchyard, unless there is
a special provision to the contrary in connection
with his endowment, a vicar, as against the
rector impropriate, is only entitled to the
possession of the churchyard for spiritual purposes.
The rector has a right to the profits of
the soil, and he or his tenants can depasture it
with sheep.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> But a rector is only at liberty to
fell the trees in the churchyard when they are
required for the repair of the chancel, or when
the body of the church requires repair and he
voluntarily allows the parishioners to use them
for the purpose.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> In new parishes the freehold
of the church and churchyard and of the vaults
belonging thereto is vested in the incumbent,
except where it has been vested in the vestry
under a local Act and they have not consented
<a name="PNanchor_145" id="PNanchor_145"><span class = "pagenum">145</span></a>to part with it.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Neither incumbents nor rectors

streets.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> So, too, an incumbent was held not
liable as owner for expenses incurred by a local
authority under a statute in removing a part of the
church which had become a dangerous structure.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_4" id="SN_9_4"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_4"><span class="label">4</span></a>. The rights of the incumbent are, moreover,
qualified and controlled by the rights of the
bishop on the one hand and of the parishioners
on the other. He has a general authority from
the bishop to decide as to allowing or disallowing
the erection in the churchyard of tombstones
with inscriptions, not being of an unusual
character in respect of size or otherwise, as well
as glass shades for wreaths and other additions
to the contents of the churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> But any
person interested may appeal against his decision
to the bishop's court, which has power to determine
the matter, subject to appeal to the higher
tribunals.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> He cannot, however, authorise the
<a name="PNanchor_146" id="PNanchor_146"><span class = "pagenum">146</span></a>erection of monuments or tablets in the church
itself, nor monuments of abnormal size in the
churchyard. These, as well as other additions to
or alterations in the church or churchyard, require
the sanction of a faculty either from the bishop's
consistory court or, if there refused, from the
provincial court or the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council. A faculty for the purpose will,
in proper cases, be granted on the application of
the incumbent and churchwardens supported by
a resolution of the vestry.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> If there is a rector
impropriate, his consent will be necessary to any
proposed change in the chancel. As already
noticed (Ch. VII. § 1 above), the incumbent cannot
validly, on his own authority, sell grave
spaces in perpetuity in the churchyard; and a
faculty will not be granted for a vault or space
for exclusive burial unless it is clearly improbable
<a name="PNanchor_147" id="PNanchor_147"><span class = "pagenum">147</span></a>that it will inconveniently diminish the available

desecrate it in any other way; but a faculty
will in a proper case be granted for diverting

of the church;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> and for throwing a portion

houses and of other necessary buildings on glebe
lands, and the repairs of chancels liable to be repaired
by rectors, have been facilitated by special
legislation. In 1777 and 1781 the Gilbert Acts
were passed,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> which, as amended by Acts of 1826
and 1838,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> enabled an incumbent, with the consent
of the bishop and patron, or, during a vacancy
<a name="PNanchor_150" id="PNanchor_150"><span class = "pagenum">150</span></a>in the living, the bishop, to borrow money for the
purpose of providing a parsonage house, or rebuilding
it in case of its having become ruinous,
upon the security of a mortgage of the income
of the benefice for thirty-five years. The loan
was not to exceed the amount of the gross net
income of the benefice, and was to be repayable
with interest by thirty yearly instalments. The
Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty were empowered
to lend money for the purposes of the
Acts; and, in practice, the loans are generally
obtained from them. A later statute<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> extended
these provisions to the purchase of land convenient
to be used with the parsonage house or
existing glebe land, and to the repair of the
chancel in cases where it is repairable by the
incumbent, and to the building or improving
of farm houses or buildings or labourers' dwelling-houses
on the glebe land; and subsequent Acts
have extended the time for repayment of the
loans.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Another series of enactments has specially

the parsonage houses and glebe lands of benefices,

The tenants, however, will have no rights against

the purpose. These provisions enable an incumbent,
subject to certain restrictions and with the

appointed in every diocese to inspect and
report as to requisite repairs and to certify
as to their due execution. The proceedings
vary according as they take place (<i>a</i>) upon
a vacancy in the benefice, or (<i>b</i>) at other
times. But in either case, after they have taken
place, a certificate of the diocesan surveyor that
the requisite works have been completed in the

walls and fences, and, in the case of a rector liable
for its repair, the chancel of the church) will (in

has become vacant,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> unless the late incumbent
was for the time being free, in respect of all the
buildings of the benefice, from liability to dilapidations,
the diocesan surveyor will inspect the
buildings or such of them as have not been included
in the exempting certificate, and will
report to the bishop what works and what
sum, if any, are required for making good the
dilapidations. Either the new incumbent, or
the late incumbent or his executors or administrators,
may send to the bishop objections to
the report, and the bishop will make an order
specifying the repairs to which the late incumbent
or his estate is liable and the cost of them.
The amount of the cost thereupon becomes a
debt from the late incumbent or his estate to the
new incumbent and may be recovered as such.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
<a name="PNanchor_154" id="PNanchor_154"><span class = "pagenum">154</span></a>Any money received in respect of it is to be paid
to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, and
they, with the consent of the bishop and patron,
may lend on the security of the possessions of the
benefice, any part of the cost which they have not
received from the new incumbent. Any additional
balance required to make up the total amount of
the cost of the repairs must be paid to them by
the new incumbent, and in case of non-payment
may be raised by sequestration of the profits of
the benefice. All the sums received or lent by them
are to be placed in the first instance to a dilapidation
account. If a vacancy occurs in a benefice
between the time of an inspection of the buildings
and the certifying of the completion of the works,
the former incumbent or his estate will be liable
for any portion of the cost of the required repairs
remaining unpaid by him, as a debt due to the
new incumbent. But the new incumbent, whether
he recovers that portion or not, will be under the
same liability to pay for the outstanding cost
of the repairs as the former incumbent would
have been had he continued to hold the benefice;
and any amount which he fails to recover from
the former incumbent or his estate may with the
consent of the bishop and patron be lent to him
by the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty on the
security of the profits of the benefice.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_12" id="SN_9_12"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_12"><span class="label">12</span></a>.(<i>b</i>) On a written complaint of the archdeacon,
the rural dean, or the patron, that the buildings
<a name="PNanchor_155" id="PNanchor_155"><span class = "pagenum">155</span></a>of a benefice are dilapidated, or at the request
of the incumbent himself, the bishop, although
no vacancy has occurred, may direct the diocesan
surveyor to inspect the buildings, unless, in the
case of a complaint on the subject, the incumbent
is himself ready to put the buildings in proper
repair, and the bishop is satisfied that this is
actually done. Such inspection may also be
directed within six months after the sequestration
of a benefice, and is to be renewed in every fifth
year while the sequestration continues. The surveyor,
in like manner as in the case of a vacancy,
will report to the bishop the works needed and
their probable cost. The incumbent or the
sequestrator may state objections to the report,
and the bishop will give his decision in writing.
If the benefice is not under sequestration, the
Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty may, with
the consent of the bishop and patron, lend on the
security of the possessions of the benefice the
whole or any part of the cost of the required
works. The amount of the loan will be placed to
a Dilapidation Account, and it will be the duty
of the incumbent to execute the required works
in the prescribed manner. If he fails to do so,
the cost may be raised by sequestration of the
benefice, and the same course will be taken as if
that had occurred before the dilapidation proceedings
had commenced. In the case of a
benefice under sequestration, the cost of the
<a name="PNanchor_156" id="PNanchor_156"><span class = "pagenum">156</span></a>required works is to be a charge on the income
of the benefice which comes into the hands of the
sequestrator, and out of that income, after providing
for the performance of the duties of the
benefice, he is to pay the amount of the cost
to the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, to be
placed by them to a dilapidation account. The
proceedings are not to be affected by any vacancy
occurring in the benefice before the works are
executed, except so far as modification may be
made in them as the result of the report of the
surveyor after his inspection consequent on the
vacancy, and except that if the benefice was
under sequestration, any unexpended amount
standing to the dilapidation account of the
sequestrator is to be carried to the dilapidation
account of the new incumbent in reduction of
the amount payable by the former incumbent
or his estate. A sequestrator who spends more
on the repairs than is authorised by the surveyor's
report is personally liable for the excess.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_13" id="SN_9_13"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_13"><span class="label">13</span></a>. When the surveyor certifies from time to
time, until the whole of the repairs have been
executed, that a certain sum ought to be paid in
respect of the required works, such sum is payable
out of the money standing to the dilapidation
account, and when all this money is exhausted,
must be paid by the incumbent himself. It is
his duty to cause the repairs to be executed,
<a name="PNanchor_157" id="PNanchor_157"><span class = "pagenum">157</span></a>unless with the consent of the bishop and patron
he decides to rebuild or to alter or remodel any
structure. In that case, if the repairs are superseded
or rendered unnecessary, the money standing
to the dilapidation account may be applied towards
the cost of the new work.</p></div>

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_14" id="SN_9_14"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_14"><span class="label">14</span></a>. It is the duty of an incumbent to keep the
parsonage house and other buildings of the benefice
(including the chancel of the church in the
case of a rector liable for its repairs) insured
against loss or damage by fire to the satisfaction
of the Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty, in the
joint names of the incumbent and themselves, in
at least three-fifths of the value of the buildings;
and the receipt for the current year's premium
in respect of the insurance must be exhibited at
the next visitation of the bishop or archdeacon.
The money received in respect of any destruction
or damage of a building which the insurance
office does not cause to be reinstated at its own
expense, is to be paid to Queen Anne's Bounty,
and dealt with in the same manner as money
standing to a dilapidation account. If the building
cannot be reinstated for the amount for which
it was insured, the diocesan surveyor is to certify
the additional sum required for the purpose, with
the same liberty to the incumbent or sequestrator
to object and the same final order of the bishop
as in the case of a report as to dilapidations.
The prescribed sum is to be paid to Queen Anne's
<a name="PNanchor_158" id="PNanchor_158"><span class = "pagenum">158</span></a>Bounty, if the benefice is not sequestrated, by
the incumbent (with power to the bishop, in
default of payment, to raise the amount by
sequestration of the benefice), or, if the benefice
is under sequestration, by the sequestrator, in the
same way as dilapidation money is payable by
the incumbent or the sequestrator, as the case
may be; and the money so paid to Queen Anne's
Bounty will be paid out on certificates of the
surveyor during the progress of the works, as in
the case of dilapidation repairs.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p></div>

on the subject, an incumbent should, as a matter
of prudence, obtain a faculty, or at any rate the
written consent of the bishop and patron, before
making any substantial alteration in the parsonage
house or other buildings of the benefice. If
he fails to do so, he proceeds at the risk of himself
and his estate; and if his action is afterwards
challenged, it will lie upon him or his executors
to prove that it was justifiable.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The precaution

<a name="PNanchor_159" id="PNanchor_159"><span class = "pagenum">159</span></a>With regard to any building belonging to or
forming part of a parsonage house which appears
to be unnecessary, the bishop, on the application
of the incumbent, and with the written consent

its removal; and any net proceeds of the removal
will be applied to the improvement of the benefice
in such manner as the bishop and patron may
agree.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The foregoing remarks do not apply to

for two months after his death;<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> and in

amending Acts, a tithe commutation rentcharge
has now been substituted for all the ancient
tithes, except tithes of fish or of fishing, personal
tithes (other than the tithes of mills), mineral
<a name="PNanchor_161" id="PNanchor_161"><span class = "pagenum">161</span></a>tithes, payments instead of tithes within the
City of London, permanent rentcharges or other
payments in lieu of tithes calculated on the rent
or value of houses or lands in a city or town
under a custom or private Act, and tithes commuted
or extinguished under a previous Act.
And any of the excepted tithes and payments, as
well as Easter offerings, mortuaries, and surplice
fees, could be brought within the operation of
the Acts by special provisions inserted in the
parochial agreements framed under the Acts
and approved by the Tithe Commissioners.<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
Where the rectory is impropriate and there is a
vicarage, the tithe commutation rentcharge payable
to the rector has been assessed in lieu of
the rectorial or great tithes, namely, those on
corn, hay and wood, and the rentcharge payable
to the vicar has been assessed in lieu of the
vicarial or small tithes, those on fruits, herbs,
live stock, poultry, milk, cheese, and eggs. Under
the earlier Acts an extraordinary tithe rentcharge
was leviable on lands for the time being cultivated
as hop gardens, orchards, fruit plantations, and
market gardens; but this special rentcharge has
since been abolished, the lands which had been in
practice liable to it having been made liable to a
fixed additional rentcharge instead.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The ordinary
<a name="PNanchor_162" id="PNanchor_162"><span class = "pagenum">162</span></a>tithe rentcharge varies with the average prices of
wheat, barley, and oats during the preceding seven
years. It was originally assessed on the footing
that £33, 6s. 8d. would buy 94.96 bushels of
wheat, or 168.42 bushels of barley, or 242.42
bushels of oats; so that £100 of rentcharge was
equivalent to those amounts of the three grains.
The actual amount of £100 nominal rentcharge
in any year is accordingly the sum which would
buy those amounts of the three grains at the
septennial average prices published in the <i>London
Gazette</i> at the beginning of the year.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p></div>

months, it may be recovered on application to
the county court, (<i>a</i>) if the owner is in occupation
of the land, by distress, or, if there is no sufficient
distress, by proceedings to obtain possession of the
land under section 82 of the Tithe Act, 1836, and

the former, an Act of 1548 provides that all persons
who by the laws or customs of the realm ought so
to do, shall yearly pay their offerings to the
parson or vicar of the parish in which they dwell
at the accustomed four offering days, or in

and it is reasonable that voluntary Easter offerings
<a name="PNanchor_164" id="PNanchor_164"><span class = "pagenum">164</span></a>should now be made on quite another scale. The

person's death are due in certain places by
custom, and, where so due, are recoverable in
the ecclesiastical courts. But by an Act of 1529,
they were limited to 10s. as the maximum and to
small amounts where the deceased died worth less
than £40 in movable goods, none being payable
if the deceased was not a householder and worth
at least ten marks in movable goods, and a penalty
was attached to demanding an illegal amount.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p></div>

depends wholly or in part upon pew rents. They
can only legally be taken where authorised by a
special or general Act of Parliament. In some
churches they have been sanctioned by a special
Act, which prescribes their application, and the
proportion (if any) which shall go towards the
<a name="PNanchor_165" id="PNanchor_165"><span class = "pagenum">165</span></a>incumbent's stipend. They are also sanctioned
in certain cases by the Church Building Acts
and New Parishes Acts. Where pew rents are
fixed under these Acts, the incumbent is entitled
to such portion of them as may be settled in the
manner therein prescribed;<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> and he can recover

<div class="section"><p><a name="SN_9_24" id="SN_9_24"></a><a href="#SNanchor_9_24"><span class="label">24</span></a>. The incumbents of certain ancient benefices
above the yearly value of £50 are liable to the
payment to Queen Anne's Bounty of first fruits in
the first year of their incumbency and tenths in
succeeding years. The first fruits are the amount
of one year's value of the benefice as recorded in
the <i>valor beneficiorum</i> or King's Books compiled
in the sixteenth century, and the tenths are one-tenth
of the same amount. They were originally
<a name="PNanchor_166" id="PNanchor_166"><span class = "pagenum">166</span></a>paid to the Pope, and were annexed by Henry
VIII. to the Crown, until Queen Anne bestowed
them on the Bounty which bears her name, to
form a fund for the augmentation of poor livings.
Where they are payable, first fruits are due
three months after admission to the benefice, and
tenths annually at Christmas. An incumbent is
only chargeable with the whole of the first fruits
if he remains incumbent at the end of two years
from the occurrence of the vacancy which he was
appointed to fill. He is liable to none, or to
one-fourth, one-half or three-fourths, if he dies
or is removed within the first, second, third, or
fourth half-year after that event.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Two Acts

the payment of first fruits and tenths all benefices
which at the time were under the annual
value of £50, except that those of which the
tenths had been previously granted away by the
Crown to other parties were still to continue
liable to tenths only. Other exemptions have
been granted in favour of particular benefices at
different times; and in 1837, out of 10,498 benefices
with and without cure of souls, only 4898
remained liable to tenths, 4500 of that number
being also liable to first fruits.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p></div>

incumbent under schedule (A) in respect of his
house of residence, glebe lands, and tithe rentcharge.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
In respect of any landed property
(other than a house of residence) actually occupied
by him, income tax is also payable on
one-third of its annual value, except that if he
occupies it for the sole purpose of husbandry and
can show that his profits fell short of that one-third,
the tax is payable on the actual amount of
the profits.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The tax is also payable by him in
respect of all other stipend, fees, perquisites and
profits accruing to him by reason of his incumbency.
But in estimating these a clergyman or
other minister of religion may deduct money paid
and expenses incurred wholly, exclusively, and
necessarily in the performance of his ministerial
duties. In two Scotch cases these deductions
were held to include the expense of visiting
members of his congregation, attending church
meetings enjoined on him as part of his duty,
outlay on stationery, and communion expenses;
but no deduction was allowed in respect of part
of the manse used as an office for his clerical
business, or for the cost of books or for a
voluntary contribution made by him towards
<a name="PNanchor_168" id="PNanchor_168"><span class = "pagenum">168</span></a>the stipend of an assistant minister.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> There is
sometimes a difficulty in determining whether
sums of money which are granted or given to a
clergyman, but are not part of his legal or recognised
stipend, are taxable perquisites or profits
accruing to him by reason of his office or not.
The true test, namely, whether the gift is made
to him in respect of his office or is personal to
himself, is not easy to apply in particular instances.
In another Scotch case it was held that a voluntary
contribution made by parishioners to their minister,
and received by him in respect of the discharge
of the duties of his office, was taxable.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
A grant to a curate by the Curates' Augmentation
Fund in recognition of upwards of fifteen years'
faithful service is not taxable, not being made
in respect of performing present duties. But a
grant to an incumbent from the Queen Victoria
Clergy Fund, being made in respect of the poverty
of his benefice, was decided by the Court of Appeal
to be taxable, although the Divisional Court
below had held the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p></div>

sole charge not only of money collected in church but of
money collected by appeals within and outside the parish.
He should in all such cases lodge it at a bank on a separate
account, and notify in his appeal that this will be done. He
cannot otherwise reasonably expect to be entrusted with
money by strangers; and if the money is mixed with his
own, it may be difficult or impossible to disentangle it in
the event of his sudden illness and death.</p></div>

Church law, until reversed or altered by future judicial decisions
or by legislation. As intimated in the Preface, no
opinion is here expressed as to their correctness, or as to
what the law ought to be on the points with which they deal.
It has been questioned whether in the Ornaments Rubric and
in the Act of Uniformity of 1559 (1 Eliz. c. 2), from which it
is derived, the mention of such ornaments as were in the
Church by authority of Parliament in the second year of
Edward VI. refers to the ornaments sanctioned by the First
Prayer Book of Edward VI., the use of which was enjoined
by the Act of Uniformity of 1549 (2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6, c. 1), or to
those previously in use. It may be observed that this Act is
referred to as made in the second year of the reign in the
later Act of Uniformity of 1552 (5 &amp; 6 Edw. 6, c. 1, s. 4), and
the Book itself is associated with that year in the 36th Article.
In the Bp. of Winchester's Case (1596) 2 Co. Rep. 40 a, the
Payment of Tithes Act of the same session (2 &amp; 3 Edw. 6, c. 13)
is referred to as made in the Parliament holden in the second
year of Edward VI. See also Westerton <i>v.</i> Liddell (1857)

for "Matins," was repeated in the Prayer Books of 1552 and
1559. On the other hand, in our present Prayer Book, where
the allusion to Morning Prayer is omitted from the rubric,
the intention that it shall, in the ordinary course, precede
the Holy Communion is indicated by the fact that Matt. xxvi.
and John xviii. have been removed from the Gospels for
Palm Sunday and Good Friday, where they had previously
stood with the succeeding passages which form our present
Gospels for those days, and have been made the Second
Lessons at Morning Prayer. In the earlier Prayer Books no
special second lessons were assigned for those two days.
But as to the use of Morning Prayer, the Litany, and the
Holy Communion together, or in varying order as separate
services, see now § 1 above. The Prayer Book does not seem
to contemplate Communion more than once in the day.
Where the Office is used oftener, it must be repeated entire
on each occasion.</p></div>

child, and had the banns published in the name of her
mother, which she had never in fact borne, Sir John Dodson,
in adjudging the marriage void, said that he had some doubt
whether, in the case of an illegitimate child, the publication
of the banns in the name of its mother, instead of the name
of notoriety and repute, would necessarily be such an undue
publication as would nullify the marriage.  No doubt the
name which a person under such circumstances had fully
acquired was that in which the publication of banns should
take place; but there might be a case in which, without
fraudulent intent, and from an innocent misapprehension of
what was correct, the name of the mother might be used
instead of that subsequently acquired; Tooth <i>v.</i> Barrow

generation, but is also the common property of the
living and of generations yet unborn, and is subject only to
temporary appropriations. An exclusive title to a portion of
it is sometimes given by faculty to some family or individual
possessing a good claim to be favoured by such a distinction.
But even a bricked grave, in the absence of a faculty, is an
aggression upon the common interests of the parishioners, and
carries the pretensions of the dead to an extent which violates
the rights of the living. Per Sir W. Scott (afterwards Lord
Stowell), Gilbert <i>v.</i> Buzzard (1821) 2 Hag. Cons. 333, at p. 353.</p></div>

The Prayer Book of 1549 directed that if on the same day
there was a celebration in church, the priest should reserve
(at the open Communion) so much of the Sacrament of the
body and blood as should serve the sick person and so many,
if any, as should communicate with him, and so soon as
convenient after the open Communion should go and minister
the same first to any appointed to communicate with the
sick person, and last of all to the sick person himself, after
having previously made the general confession and added
the absolution and the comfortable words of Scripture as in
the Communion Office; and after the administration he
was to say the Collect "Almighty and everliving God, we
most heartily thank," &amp;c. But if the day were not appointed
for the open Communion, then the curate should come and
visit the sick person afore noon and celebrate the Holy
Communion according to the Order for the Communion of
the Sick. But these directions were omitted in 1552, and
have not since been restored.</p></div>

5 Vict. c. 38, 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 37, 14 &amp; 15 Vict. c. 24), land may
under certain restrictions be conveyed to the minister and
churchwardens and overseers of the poor, or to the ministers
and churchwardens, of a parish, for the purpose of the education
of the poor, and when so conveyed will remain vested
in them and their successors as if they were a corporate
body; but, except where authorised by a special local
Act, it cannot be conveyed to the incumbent and churchwardens,
or to the churchwardens alone, in perpetuity
for any other purpose. (In the City of London, however,
churchwardens can, by custom, acquire and hold land as a
corporation for ecclesiastical or parochial purposes.) The
Bodies Corporate (Joint Tenancy) Act, 1899 (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. 20),
does not give any further power to an incumbent to hold property
as a corporation jointly with another corporation or
with individuals upon any ecclesiastical or charitable trusts;
since the holding authorised by the Act is to be subject to
the same conditions and restrictions as attach to its holding
by a body corporate in severalty; and an incumbent as above
mentioned could not, without a licence in mortmain, hold as
a corporation by himself any property upon similar trusts,
unless empowered to do so by express statutory authority.</p></div>

repairs or redecoration where no alteration is made in the
structure or the design, nor for trifling additions such as
movable seats or hassocks. But a change in the mode of
lighting or heating the church ought to be sanctioned by
faculty. The grant of a faculty, besides ensuring that all
is done legally and carefully, prevents any ill-feeling being
cherished in the parish on the score of the alteration having
been made without the knowledge or consent of some of the
parishioners; since the application for the faculty affords to
all who are interested in the matter an opportunity for submitting
their views upon it. The regular mode of obtaining
the approval of the parishioners to it is by a resolution of the
vestry. But the opinion of the vestry is not conclusive; and
a distinction will sometimes be made between the votes of
those members of the vestry who are Church people and those
who are not; see note (3) on p. 89 above.</p></div>
